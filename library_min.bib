	Abstract = {Machine learning techniques based on neural networks are achieving remarkable results in a wide variety of domains. Often, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information. The models should not expose private information in these datasets. Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.},

	Abstract = {In 1998, Sherman and Guillery proposed that there are two types of inputs to cortical neurons; drivers and modulators. These two forms of input are required to explain how, for example, sensory driven responses are controlled and modified by attention and other internally generated gating signals. One might imagine that driver signals are carried by fast ionotropic receptors, whereas modulators correspond to slower metabotropic receptors. Instead, we have proposed a novel mechanism by which both driver and modulator inputs could be carried by transmission through the same types of ionotropic receptors. In this scheme, the distinction between driver and modulator inputs is functional and changeable rather than anatomical and fixed. Driver inputs are carried by excitation and inhibition acting in a push-pull manner. This means that increases in excitation are accompanied by decreases in inhibition and vice versa. Modulators correspond to excitation and inhibition that covary so that they increase or decrease together. Theoretical and experimental work has shown that such an arrangement modulates the gain of a neuron, rather than driving it to respond. Constructing drivers and modulators in this manner allows individual excitatory synaptic inputs to play either role, and indeed to switch between roles, depending on how they are linked with inhibition.},

@article{Abdi2009,
	Abstract = {When used to analyze brain imaging data, pattern classifiers typically produce results that can be interpreted as a measure of discriminability or as a distance between some experimental categories. These results can be analyzed with techniques such as multidimensional scaling (MDS), which represent the experimental categories as points on a map. While such a map reveals the configuration of the categories, it does not provide a reliability estimate of the position of the experimental categories, and therefore cannot be used for inferential purposes. In this paper, we present a procedure that provides reliability estimates for pattern classifiers. This procedure combines bootstrap estimation (to estimate the variability of the experimental conditions) and a new 3-way extension of MDS, called DISTATIS, that can be used to integrate the distance matrices generated by the bootstrap procedure and to represent the results as MDS-like maps. Reliability estimates are expressed as (1) tolerance intervals which reflect the accuracy of the assignment of scans to experimental categories and as (2) confidence intervals which generalize standard hypothesis testing. When more than two categories are involved in the application of a pattern classifier, the use of confidence intervals for null hypothesis testing inflates Type I error. We address this problem with a Bonferonni-like correction. Our methodology is illustrated with the results of a pattern classifier described by O'Toole et al.

@article{Afshar2011,
	Abstract = {The process by which neural circuitry in the brain plans and executes movements is not well understood. Until recently, most available data were limited either to single-neuron electrophysiological recordings or to measures of aggregate field or metabolism. Neither approach reveals how individual neurons' activities are coordinated within the population, and thus inferences about how the neural circuit forms a motor plan for an upcoming movement have been indirect. Here we build on recent advances in the measurement and description of population activity to frame and test an ``initial condition hypothesis'' of arm movement preparation and initiation. This hypothesis leads to a model in which the timing of movements may be predicted on each trial using neurons' moment-by-moment firing rates and rates of change of those rates. Using simultaneous microelectrode array recordings from premotor cortex of monkeys performing delayed-reach movements, we compare such single-trial predictions to those of other theories. We show that our model can explain approximately 4-fold more arm-movement reaction-time variance than the best alternative method. Thus, the initial condition hypothesis elucidates a view of the relationship between single-trial preparatory neural population dynamics and single-trial behavior.},

@article{Aguilera2013,
	Abstract = {Despite the increase of both dynamic and embodied/situated approaches in cognitive science, there is still little research on how coordination dynamics under a closed sensorimotor loop might induce qualitatively different patterns of neural oscillations compared to those found in isolated systems. We take as a departure point the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model, a generic model for dynamic coordination between two oscillatory components, which has proven useful for a vast range of applications in cognitive science and whose dynamical properties are well understood. In order to explore the properties of this model under closed sensorimotor conditions we present what we call the situated HKB model: a robotic model that performs a gradient climbing task and whose ``brain'' is modeled by the HKB equation. We solve the differential equations that define the agent-environment coupling for increasing values of the agent's sensitivity (sensor gain), finding different behavioral strategies. These results are compared with two different models: a decoupled HKB with no sensory input and a passively-coupled HKB that is also decoupled but receives a structured input generated by a situated agent. We can precisely quantify and qualitatively describe how the properties of the system, when studied in coupled conditions, radically change in a manner that cannot be deduced from the decoupled HKB models alone. We also present the notion of neurodynamic signature as the dynamic pattern that correlates with a specific behavior and we show how only a situated agent can display this signature compared to an agent that simply receives the exact same sensory input. To our knowledge, this is the first analytical solution of the HKB equation in a sensorimotor loop and qualitative and quantitative analytic comparison of spatially coupled vs. decoupled oscillatory controllers. Finally, we discuss the limitations and possible generalization of our model to contemporary neuroscience and philosophy of mind.},

@article{Ahilan2019,
	Abstract = {Humans and other animals are able to discover underlying statistical structure in their environments and exploit it to achieve efficient and effective performance. However, such structure is often difficult to learn and use because it is obscure, involving long-range temporal dependencies. Here, we analysed behavioural data from an extended experiment with rats, showing that the subjects learned the underlying statistical structure, albeit suffering at times from immediate inferential imperfections as to their current state within it. We accounted for their behaviour using a Hidden Markov Model, in which recent observations are integrated with evidence from the past. We found that over the course of training, subjects came to track their progress through the task more accurately, a change that our model largely attributed to improved integration of past evidence. This learning reflected the structure of the task, decreasing reliance on recent observations, which were potentially misleading.},

This study compared 8 decision learning models with respect to their generalizability. Participants performed 2 tasks (the Iowa Gambling Task and the Soochow Gambling Task), and each model made a priori predictions by estimating the parameters for each participant from 1 task and using those same parameters to predict on the other task. Three methods were used to evaluate the models at the individual level of analysis. The first method used a post hoc fit criterion, the second method used a generalization criterion for short-term predictions, and the third method again used a generalization criterion for long-term predictions. The results suggest that the models with the prospect utility function can make generalizable predictions to new conditions, and different learning models are needed for making short- versus long-term predictions on simple gambling tasks.},

However, the direct causality between cross-frequency coupling and working memory performance remains to be demonstrated. Here we externally modulated the interaction of theta and gamma rhythms in the prefrontal cortex using novel cross-frequency protocols of transcranial alternating current stimulation to affect spatial working memory performance in humans. Enhancement of working memory performance and increase of global neocortical connectivity were observed when bursts of high gamma oscillations (80\textendash{}100 Hz) coincided with the peaks of the theta waves, whereas superimposition on the trough of the theta wave and low gamma frequency protocols were ineffective. Thus, our results demonstrate the sensitivity of working memory performance and global neocortical connectivity to the phase and rhythm of the externally driven thetagamma cross-frequency synchronization.},

	Abstract = {Using a generalized random recurrent neural network model, and by extending our recently developed mean-field approach [J. Aljadeff, M. Stern, T. Sharpee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 088101 (2015)], we study the relationship between the network connectivity structure and its low dimensional dynamics. Each connection in the network is a random number with mean 0 and variance that depends on pre- and post-synaptic neurons through a sufficiently smooth function \$g\$ of their identities. We find that these networks undergo a phase transition from a silent to a chaotic state at a critical point we derive as a function of \$g\$. Above the critical point, although unit activation levels are chaotic, their autocorrelation functions are restricted to a low dimensional subspace. This provides a direct link between the network's structure and some of its functional characteristics. We discuss example applications of the general results to neuroscience where we derive the support of the spectrum of connectivity matrices with heterogeneous and possibly correlated degree distributions, and to ecology where we study the stability of the cascade model for food web structure.},

	Abstract = {The amount of information that can be retained in working-memory (WM) is limited. Limitations of WM have been the subject of intense research, especially trying to specify algorithmic models for WM. Comparatively, neural circuit perspectives have barely been used to test WM limitations in behavioral experiments. Here, we used a neuronal microcircuit model for visuo-spatial WM (vsWM) to investigate memory of several items. The model assumes that there is a topographic organization of the circuit responsible for spatial memory retention. This assumption leads to specific predictions, which we tested in psychophysics experiments. According to the model, nearby locations should be recalled with a bias, as if the two memory traces merged during the delay period. Another prediction is that the previously reported loss of memory precision for increasing number of memory items (memory load) should vanish when the distances between items are controlled for. Both predictions were confirmed experimentally. Taken together, our findings provide support for a topographic neural-circuit organization of vsWM, they suggest that interference between similar memories underlies some WM limitations, and they put forward a circuit-based explanation that reconciles previous conflicting results on the dependence of WM precision with load.},

Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We employed a landscape optimization scheme introduced previously (Alonso and Marder, 2019) to produce multiple different models that exhibit triphasic pyloric rhythms over a range of temperatures. We use the currentscapes introduced in (Alonso and Marder, 2019) to explore the dynamics of model currents and how they change with temperature. We found that temperature changes the relative contributions of the currents to neuronal activity so that rhythmic activity smoothly slides through changes in mechanisms. Moreover, the responses of the models to extreme perturbations\textemdash{}such as gradually decreasing a current type\textemdash{}are often qualitatively different at different temperatures.},

Interneurons expressing the markers parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) are leading candidates to participate in intrinsic rhythm generation and principal cell (PC) coordination in distal CA1 and subiculum. We tested their involvement by optogenetically activating and silencing PV or SOM interneurons in an intact hippocampus preparation that preserves intrinsic connections and oscillates spontaneously at theta frequencies. Despite evidence suggesting that SOM interneurons are crucial for theta, optogenetic manipulation of these interneurons modestly influenced theta rhythm. However, SOM interneurons were able to strongly modulate temporoammonic inputs. In contrast, activation of PV interneurons powerfully controlled PC network and rhythm generation optimally at 8 Hz, while continuously silencing them disrupted theta. Our results thus demonstrate a pivotal role of PV but not SOM interneurons for PC synchronization and the emergence of intrinsic hippocampal theta.},

Here, we offer an alternative perspective, arguing that they are flexible and environmentally-informed. In Study 1, we investigated risk and time preferences among children in the United States, India, and Argentina, as well as forager-horticulturalist Shuar children in Amazonian Ecuador. We find striking cross-cultural differences in behavior: children in India, the U.S., and Argentina are more risk-seeking and future-oriented, while Shuar children are more risk-averse and exhibit more heterogeneous time preferences, on average preferring more today choices. To explore one of the socioecological forces that may be shaping these preferences, in Study 2, we compared the behavior of more and less- marketintegrated Shuar children, finding that those in market-integrated regions are more futureoriented and risk-seeking. These findings indicate that cross-cultural differences in risk and time preferences can be traced into childhood and may be influenced by the local environment. More broadly, our results contribute to a growing understanding of plasticity and variation in the development of behavior.},

It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum. We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task.

	Abstract = {Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons often exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g., the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user. More generally, this framework opens the door to fitting theoretically motivated dynamical network models directly to simultaneously or non-simultaneously recorded neural responses.},

	Abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that neuronal responses are modulated by stimulus properties and also by the state of the local network. However, little is known about how activity fluctuations of neuronal populations modulate the sensory tuning of cells and affect their encoded information. We found that fluctuations in ongoing and stimulus-evoked population activity in primate visual cortex modulate the tuning of neurons in a multiplicative and additive manner. While distributed on a continuum, neurons with stronger multiplicative effects tended to have less additive modulation and vice versa. The information encoded by multiplicatively modulated neurons increased with greater population activity, while that of additively modulated neurons decreased. These effects offset each other so that population activity had little effect on total information. Our results thus suggest that intrinsic activity fluctuations may act as a ``traffic light'' that determines which subset of neurons is most informative.},

	Abstract = {Neural responses in visual cortex are influenced by visual stimuli and by ongoing spiking activity in local circuits. An important challenge in computational neuroscience is to develop models that can account for both of these features in large multi-neuron recordings and to reveal how stimulus representations interact with and depend on cortical dynamics. Here we introduce a statistical model of neural population activity that integrates a nonlinear receptive field model with a latent dynamical model of ongoing cortical activity. This model captures temporal dynamics and correlations due to shared stimulus drive as well as common noise. Moreover, because the nonlinear stimulus inputs are mixed by the ongoing dynamics, the model can account for a multiple idiosyncratic receptive field shapes with a small number of nonlinear inputs to a low-dimensional dynamical model. We introduce a fast estimation method using online expectation maximization with Laplace approximations, for which inference scales linearly in both population size and recording duration. We test this model to multi-channel recordings from primary visual cortex and show that it accounts for neural tuning properties as well as cross-neural correlations.},

	Abstract = {We examine the role of memorization in deep learning, drawing connections to capacity, generalization, and adversarial robustness. While deep networks are capable of memorizing noise data, our results suggest that they tend to prioritize learning simple patterns first. In our experiments, we expose qualitative differences in gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) on noise vs. real data. We also demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit regularization (e.g., dropout) we can degrade DNN training performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization on real data. Our analysis suggests that the notions of effective capacity which are dataset independent are unlikely to explain the generalization performance of deep networks when trained with gradient based methods because training data itself plays an important role in determining the degree of memorization.},

The approach, BOSS (Best of Sampled Set), drives exploration by sampling multiple models from the posterior and selecting actions optimistically. It extends previous work by providing a rule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show that our algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a sample complexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posterior distribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quite favorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches and illustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model that generalizes across states.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal networks exhibit a rich dynamical repertoire, a consequence of both the intrinsic properties of neurons and the structure of the network. It has been hypothesized that inhibitory interneurons corral principal neurons into transiently synchronous ensembles that encode sensory information and subserve behavior. How does the structure of the inhibitory network facilitate such spatiotemporal patterning? We established a relationship between an important structural property of a network, its colorings, and the dynamics it constrains. Using a model of the insect antennal lobe, we show that our description allows the explicit identification of the groups of inhibitory interneurons that switch, during odor stimulation, between activity and quiescence in a coordinated manner determined by features of the network structure. This description optimally matches the perspective of the downstream neurons looking for synchrony in ensembles of presynaptic cells and allows a low-dimensional description of seemingly complex high-dimensional network activity.},

	Abstract = {Neurons recruited for local computations exhibit rhythmic activity at gamma frequencies. The amplitude and frequency of these oscillations are continuously modulated depending on stimulus and behavioral state. This modulation is believed to crucially control information flow across cortical areas. Here we report that in the rat hippocampus gamma oscillation amplitude and frequency vary rapidly, from one cycle to the next. Strikingly, the amplitude of one oscillation predicts the interval to the next. Using in vivo and in vitro whole-cell recordings, we identify the underlying mechanism. We show that cycle-bycycle fluctuations in amplitude reflect changes in synaptic excitation spanning over an order of magnitude. Despite these rapid variations, synaptic excitation is immediately and proportionally counterbalanced by inhibition. These rapid adjustments in inhibition instantaneously modulate oscillation frequency. So, by rapidly balancing excitation with inhibition, the hippocampal network is able to swiftly modulate gamma oscillations over a wide band of frequencies.},

By using a detailed simulation of intracerebral recordings, we show that this model is able to reproduce both the theta-nested gamma oscillations that are seen in awake brains and the sharp-wave ripple complexes measured during slow-wave sleep. The results of our simulations support the idea that the functional connectivity of the hippocampus, modulated by the sleep-wake variations in Acetylcholine concentration, is a key factor in controlling its rhythms.},

In this paper we show that modern CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2) can drastically change their output when an image is translated in the image plane by a few pixels, and that this failure of generalization also happens with other realistic small image transformations. Furthermore, the deeper the network the more we see these failures to generalize. We show that these failures are related to the fact that the architecture of modern CNNs ignores the classical sampling theorem so that generalization is not guaranteed. We also show that biases in the statistics of commonly used image datasets makes it unlikely that CNNs will learn to be invariant to these transformations. Taken together our results suggest that the performance of CNNs in object recognition falls far short of the generalization capabilities of humans.},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to self-supervised representation learning based on maximizing mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of a shared context. For example, one could produce multiple views of a local spatiotemporal context by observing it from different locations (e.g., camera positions within a scene), and via different modalities (e.g., tactile, auditory, or visual). Or, an ImageNet image could provide a context from which one produces multiple views by repeatedly applying data augmentation. Maximizing mutual information between features extracted from these views requires capturing information about high-level factors whose influence spans multiple views \textendash{} e.g., presence of certain objects or occurrence of certain events. Following our proposed approach, we develop a model which learns image representations that significantly outperform prior methods on the tasks we consider. Most notably, using self-supervised learning, our model learns representations which achieve 68.1\% accuracy on ImageNet using standard linear evaluation. This beats prior results by over 12\% and concurrent results by 7\%. When we extend our model to use mixture-based representations, segmentation behaviour emerges as a natural side-effect.

In our companion paper (Frank MJ, Badre D. 2011. Mechanisms of hierarchical reinforcement learning in corticostriatal circuits I: computational analysis. 22:509--526), we provide novel neural circuit and algorithmic models of hierarchical cognitive control in cortico--striatal circuits. Here, we test key model predictions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our neural circuit model proposes that contextual representations in rostral frontal cortex influence the striatal gating of contextual representations in caudal frontal cortex. Reinforcement learning operates at each level, such that the system adaptively learns to gate higher order contextual information into rostral regions. Our algorithmic Bayesian ``mixture of experts'' model captures the key computations of this neural model and provides trial-by-trial estimates of the learner's latent hypothesis states. In the present paper, we used these quantitative estimates to reanalyze fMRI data from a hierarchical reinforcement learning task reported in Badre D, Kayser AS, D'Esposito M. 2010. Frontal cortex and the discovery of abstract action rules. Neuron. 66:315\textendash{}326. Results validate key predictions of the models and provide evidence for an individual cortico--striatal circuit for reinforcement learning of hierarchical structure at a specific level of policy abstraction. These findings are initially consistent with the proposal that hierarchical control in frontal cortex may emerge from interactions among nested cortico--striatal circuits at different levels of abstraction.},

Unfortunately, this guarantee fails in settings, such as generative adversarial nets, where there are multiple interacting losses. The behavior of gradient-based methods in games is not well understood \textendash{} and is becoming increasingly important as adversarial and multiobjective architectures proliferate. In this paper, we develop new techniques to understand and control the dynamics in general games. The key result is to decompose the second-order dynamics into two components. The first is related to potential games, which reduce to gradient descent on an implicit function; the second relates to Hamiltonian games, a new class of games that obey a conservation law, akin to conservation laws in classical mechanical systems. The decomposition motivates Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (SGA), a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in general games. Basic experiments show SGA is competitive with recently proposed algorithms for finding stable fixed points in GANs \textendash{} whilst at the same time being applicable to \textendash{} and having guarantees in \textendash{} much more general games.},

In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed `forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate `back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent.},

	Abstract = {Transfer in reinforcement learning refers to the notion that generalization should occur not only within a task but also across tasks. We propose a transfer framework for the scenario where the reward function changes between tasks but the environment's dynamics remain the same. Our approach rests on two key ideas: successor features, a value function representation that decouples the dynamics of the environment from the rewards, and generalized policy improvement, a generalization of dynamic programming's policy improvement operation that considers a set of policies rather than a single one. Put together, the two ideas lead to an approach that integrates seamlessly within the reinforcement learning framework and allows the free exchange of information across tasks. The proposed method also provides performance guarantees for the transferred policy even before any learning has taken place. We derive two theorems that set our approach in firm theoretical ground and present experiments that show that it successfully promotes transfer in practice, significantly outperforming alternative methods in a sequence of navigation tasks and in the control of a simulated robotic arm.},

	Abstract = {There is evidence that biological synapses have a limited number of discrete weight states. Memory storage with such synapses behaves quite differently from synapses with unbounded, continuous weights, as old memories are automatically overwritten by new memories. Consequently, there has been substantial discussion about how this affects learning and storage capacity. In this paper, we calculate the storage capacity of discrete, bounded synapses in terms of Shannon information. We use this to optimize the learning rules and investigate how the maximum information capacity depends on the number of synapses, the number of synaptic states, and the coding sparseness. Below a certain critical number of synapses per neuron (comparable to numbers found in biology), we find that storage is similar to unbounded, continuous synapses. Hence, discrete synapses do not necessarily have lower storage capacity.},

@article{Bartunov,
	Abstract = {The backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) is often said to be impossible to implement in a real brain. The recent success of deep networks in machine learning and AI, however, has inspired proposals for understanding how the brain might learn across multiple layers, and hence how it might implement or approximate BP. As of yet, none of these proposals have been rigorously evaluated on tasks where BP-guided deep learning has proved critical, or in architectures more structured than simple fully-connected networks. Here we present the first results on scaling up biologically motivated models of deep learning on datasets which need deep networks with appropriate architectures to achieve good performance. We present results on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets and explore variants of target-propagation (TP) and feedback alignment (FA) algorithms, and explore performance in both fully- and locally-connected architectures. We also introduce weight-transport-free variants of difference target propagation (DTP) modified to remove backpropagation from the penultimate layer. Many of these algorithms perform well for MNIST, but for CIFAR and ImageNet we find that TP and FA variants perform significantly worse than BP, especially for networks composed of locally connected units, opening questions about whether new architectures and algorithms are required to scale these approaches. Our results and implementation details help establish baselines for biologically motivated deep learning schemes going forward.},

In addition, psychiatric conditions often manifested as compulsive behaviours, are emerging as a serious problem in the management of L-dopa therapy. The present review attempts to provide an overview of our current understanding of dyskinesia and other L-dopainduced dysfunctions, a field that dramatically evolved in the past twenty years. In view of the extensive literature on LID, there appeared a critical need to re-frame the concepts, to highlight the most suitable models, to review the central nervous system (CNS) circuitry that may be involved, and to propose a pathophysiological framework was timely and necessary. An updated review to clarify our understanding of LID and other L-dopa-related side effects was therefore timely and necessary.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental goal of systems neuroscience is to understand the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Behavior has traditionally been characterized by low-dimensional, task-related variables such as movement speed or response times. More recently, there has been a growing interest in automated analysis of high-dimensional video data collected during experiments. Here we introduce a probabilistic framework for the analysis of behavioral video and neural activity. This framework provides tools for compression, segmentation, generation, and decoding of behavioral videos. Compression is performed using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which yields a low-dimensional continuous representation of behavior. We then use an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) to segment the CAE representation into discrete ``behavioral syllables.'' The resulting generative model can be used to simulate behavioral video data. Finally, based on this generative model, we develop a novel Bayesian decoding approach that takes in neural activity and outputs probabilistic estimates of the full-resolution behavioral video. We demonstrate this framework on two different experimental paradigms using distinct behavioral and neural recording technologies.},

	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has been a mainstay of human neuroscience for the past 25 years. The goal for this research has largely been to understand how activity across brain structures relates to mental constructs and computations. However, interpretation of fMRI data has often occurred within knowledge frameworks crafted by experts, which have the potential to reify historical trends and amplify the subjective biases that limit the replicability of findings.
            1
            In other words, we lack a comprehensive data-driven ontology for structure-function mapping in the human brain, through which we can also test the explanatory value of current dominant conceptual frameworks. Ontologies in other fields are popular tools for automated data synthesis,
            2, 3
            yet relatively few attempts have been made to engineer ontologies in a data-driven manner.
            4
            Here, we employ a computational approach to derive a data-driven ontology for neurobiological domains that synthesizes the texts and data of nearly 20,000 human neuroimaging articles. The data-driven ontology includes 6 domains, each defined by a circuit of brain structures and its associated mental functions. Several of these domains are omitted from the leading framework in neuroscience, while others uncover novel combinations of mental functions related to common brain circuitry. Crucially, the structure-function links in each domain better replicate across articles in held-out data than those mapped from the dominant frameworks in neuroscience and psychiatry. We further show that the data-driven ontology partitions the literature into modular subfields, for which the domains serve as generalizable archetypes of the structure-function patterns observed in single articles. The approach to computational ontology we present here is the most comprehensive functional characterization of human brain circuits quantifiable with fMRI. Moreover, our methods can be extended to synthesize other scientific literatures, yielding ontologies that are built up from the data of the field.},

	Abstract = {In this article we introduce the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE): both a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development of general, domain-independent AI technology. ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.},

Specifically, we focus on the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from the intrinsic motivation literature, we use density models to measure uncertainty, and propose a novel algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count from an arbitrary density model. This technique enables us to generalize count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case. We apply our ideas to Atari 2600 games, providing sensible pseudo-counts from raw pixels. We transform these pseudo-counts into exploration bonuses and obtain significantly improved exploration in a number of hard games, including the infamously difficult MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE.},

	Abstract = {To separate neural signals from noise, brain responses measured in neuroimaging are routinely averaged across space and time. However, such procedures may obscure some properties of neural activity. Recently, multi-voxel pattern analysis methods have demonstrated that patterns of activity across voxels contain valuable information that is concealed by spatial averaging. Here we show that temporal patterns of neural activity contain information that can discriminate different stimuli, even within brain regions that show no net activation to that stimulus class. Furthermore, we find that in many brain regions, responses to natural stimuli are highly context dependent. In such cases, prototypical event-related responses do not even exist for individual stimuli, so that averaging responses to the same stimulus within different contexts may worsen the effective signal-to-noise. As a result, analysis of the temporal structures of single events can reveal aspects of neural dynamics which cannot be detected using standard event-related averaging methods.},

We show that, when players learn using weighted stochastic fictitious play and so place greater weight on more recent experience, the time average of play often converges in these ``unstable'' games, even while mixed strategies and beliefs continue to cycle. This time average, the TASP, is related to the best response cycle first identified by Shapley (1964). Though conceptually distinct from Nash equilibrium, for many games the TASP is close enough to Nash to create the appearance of convergence to equilibrium. We discuss how these theoretical results may help to explain data from recent experimental studies of price dispersion.},

The new rule changes a synaptic weight in proportion to the product of the presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of activity on the postsynaptic side. These quantities are interesting for studying theoretical explanation for synaptic changes from a machine learning perspective. In particular, if neural dynamics moved neural activity towards reducing some objective function, then this STDP rule would correspond to stochastic gradient descent on that objective function.},

We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-TimingDependent Plasticity) can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the robust observation from the psychology literature that partial reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning. This effect is magnified in the repeated game: When others are slow to learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning, can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned from experience.},

@article{Bergstra,
	Abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ``High Throughput'' methods achieve surprising success\textemdash{}they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	Abstract = {A novel direction to existing neural mass modeling technique is proposed where the commonly used ``alpha function'' for representing synaptic transmission is replaced by a kinetic framework of neurotransmitter and receptor dynamics. The aim is to underpin neuro-transmission dynamics associated with abnormal brain rhythms commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders. An existing thalamocortical neural mass model is modified by using the kinetic framework for modeling synaptic transmission mediated by glutamatergic and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric-acid)-ergic receptors. The model output is compared qualitatively with existing literature on in vitro experimental studies of ferret thalamic slices, as well as on single-neuron-level model based studies of neuro-receptor and transmitter dynamics in the thalamocortical tissue. The results are consistent with these studies: the activation of ligand-gated GABA receptors is essential for generation of spindle waves in the model, while blocking this pathway leads to low-frequency synchronized oscillations such as observed in slow-wave sleep; the frequency of spindle oscillations increase with increased levels of post-synaptic membrane conductance for AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic-acid) receptors, and blocking this pathway effects a quiescent model output. In terms of computational efficiency, the simulation time is improved by a factor of 10 compared to a similar neural mass model based on alpha functions. This implies a dramatic improvement in computational resources for large-scale network simulation using this model. Thus, the model provides a platform for correlating high-level brain oscillatory activity with low-level synaptic attributes, and makes a significant contribution toward advancements in current neural mass modeling paradigm as a potential computational tool to better the understanding of brain oscillations in sickness and in health.},

	Abstract = {The neocortex is a major component of the most sophisticated and economically significant computer in existence, nevertheless the organisation and operation of its computational circuit is not yet understood. Here we make some steps toward relating anatomical structure to computational function. We use methods of quantitative neuroanatomy to estimate the cortical circuit by defining the projection matrix between the various cells types of the neocortex of the cat, and then we consider the implications of this connectivity for cortical signal processing. Our analyses show that for a reasonable choice of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory efficacy, the overall cortical circuit lies near the border of dynamical stability. We discuss a model of co-operative competitive processing that is consistent with the observed connectivity in the superficial layers of the cortex, and consider also how the topology of the overall cortical circuit could be configured dynamically through average inhibition.},

	Abstract = {Uniform and modular primary hippocampal cultures from embryonic rats were grown on commercially available microelectrode arrays to investigate network activity with respect to development and integration of different neuronal populations. Modular networks consisting of two confined active and inter-connected sub-populations of neurons were realized by means of bi-compartmental polydimethylsiloxane structures. Spontaneous activity in both uniform and modular cultures was periodically monitored, from three up to eight weeks after plating. Compared to uniform cultures and despite lower cellular density, modular networks interestingly showed higher firing rates at earlier developmental stages, and network-wide firing and bursting statistics were less variable over time. Although globally less correlated than uniform cultures, modular networks exhibited also higher intra-cluster than inter-cluster correlations, thus demonstrating that segregation and integration of activity coexisted in this simple yet powerful in vitro model. Finally, the peculiar synchronized bursting activity shown by confined modular networks preferentially propagated within one of the two compartments (`dominant'), even in cases of perfect balance of firing rate between the two sub-populations. This dominance was generally maintained during the entire monitored developmental frame, thus suggesting that the implementation of this hierarchy arose from early network development.},

	Abstract = {Growing graphs describe a multitude of developing processes from maturing brains to expanding vocabularies to burgeoning public transit systems. Each of these growing processes likely adheres to proliferation rules that establish an effective order of node and connection emergence. When followed, such proliferation rules allow the system to properly develop along a predetermined trajectory. But rules are rarely followed. Here we ask what topological changes in the growing graph trajectories might occur after the specific but basic perturbation of permuting the node emergence order. Specifically we harness applied topological methods to determine which of six growing graph models exhibit topology that is robust to randomizing node order, termed global reorderability, and robust to temporally-local node swaps, termed local reorderability. We find that the six graph models fall upon a spectrum of both local and global reorderability, and furthermore we provide theoretical connections between robustness to node pair ordering and robustness to arbitrary node orderings. Finally we discuss real-world applications of reorderability analyses and suggest possibilities for designing reorderable networks.},

	Abstract = {We derive fundamental lower bounds on the connectivity and the memory requirements of deep neural networks guaranteeing uniform approximation rates for arbitrary function classes in L2(Rd). In other words, we establish a connection between the complexity of a function class and the complexity of deep neural networks approximating functions from this class to within a prescribed accuracy. Additionally, we prove that our lower bounds are achievable for a broad family of function classes. Specifically, all function classes that are optimally approximated by a general class of representation systems\textemdash{}so-called affine systems\textemdash{}can be approximated by deep neural networks with minimal connectivity and memory requirements. Affine systems encompass a wealth of representation systems from applied harmonic analysis such as wavelets, ridgelets, curvelets, shearlets, {$\alpha$}-shearlets, and, more generally, {$\alpha$}-molecules. Our central result elucidates a remarkable universality property of neural networks and shows that they achieve the optimum approximation properties of all affine systems combined. As a specific example, we consider the class of {$\alpha{}-$}1-cartoon-like functions, which is approximated optimally by {$\alpha$}-shearlets. We also explain how our results can be extended to the approximation of functions on low-dimensional immersed manifolds. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating that the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm yields deep neural networks with close-to-optimal approximation rates. Moreover, these results indicate that stochastic gradient descent can learn approximations that are sparse in the representation systems optimally sparsifying the function class the network is trained on.},

	Abstract = {When operating in a complex world, it is essential to have mechanisms that can suppress distracting information [1, 2]. Such mechanisms might be related to neuronal oscillations, which are known to be involved in gating of incoming information [3]. We here apply a working memory (WM) task to investigate how neuronal oscillations are involved in the suppression of distracting information that can be predicted in time. We used a modified Sternberg WM task in which distracters were presented in the retention interval, while we recorded the ongoing brain activity using magnetoencephalography. The data revealed a robust adjustment of the phase of alpha oscillations in anticipation of the distracter. In trials with strong phase adjustment, response times to the memory probe were reduced. Further, the power of alpha oscillations increased prior to the distracter and predicted performance. Our findings demonstrate that the doors of perception close when a distracter is expected. The phase adjustment of the alpha rhythm adds to the computational versatility of brain oscillations, because such a mechanism allows for modulating neuronal processing on a fine temporal scale.},

To better characterize the modes and reasons of failure of deep reinforcement learners, we test the widely used Asynchronous Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm on four deceptive games, which are specially designed to provide challenges to game-playing agents. These games are implemented in the General Video Game AI framework, which allows us to compare the behavior of reinforcement learningbased agents with planning agents based on tree search. We find that several of these games reliably deceive deep reinforcement learners, and that the resulting behavior highlights the shortcomings of the learning algorithm. The particular ways in which agents fail differ from how planning-based agents fail, further illuminating the character of these algorithms. We propose an initial typology of deceptions which could help us better understand pitfalls and failure modes of (deep) reinforcement learning.},

Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses show that inhibition accounts for a significant, but modest, part of the age-related variance in working memory.

	Abstract = {The most basic functional role commonly ascribed to synchrony in the brain is that of amplifying excitatory neuronal signals. The reasoning is straightforward: When positive charge is injected into a leaky target neuron over a time window of positive duration, some of it will have time to leak back out before an action potential is triggered in the target, and it will in that sense be wasted. If the goal is to elicit a firing response in the target using as little charge as possible, it seems best to deliver the charge all at once, i.e., in perfect synchrony. In this article, we show that this reasoning is correct only if one assumes that the input ceases when the target crosses the firing threshold, but before it actually fires. If the input ceases later\textemdash{}for instance, in response to a feedback signal triggered by the firing of the target\textemdash{}the ``most economical'' way of delivering input (the way that requires the least total amount of input) is no longer precisely synchronous, but merely approximately so. If the target is a heterogeneous network, as it always is in the brain, then ceasing the input ``when the target crosses the firing threshold'' is not an option, because there is no single moment when the firing threshold is crossed. In this sense, precise synchrony is never optimal in the brain.},

We extracted 147,328 correlations and developed a hierarchical taxonomy of variables reported in Journal of Applied Psychology and Personnel Psychology from 1980 to 2010 to produce empirical effect size benchmarks at the omnibus level, for 20 common research domains, and for an even finer grained level of generality. Results indicate that the usual interpretation and classification of effect sizes as small, medium, and large bear almost no resemblance to findings in the field, because distributions of effect sizes exhibit tertile partitions at values approximately one-half to one-third those intuited by Cohen (1988). Our results offer information that can be used for research planning and design purposes, such as producing better informed non-nil hypotheses and estimating statistical power and planning sample size accordingly. We also offer information useful for understanding the relative importance of the effect sizes found in a particular study in relationship to others and which research domains have advanced more or less, given that larger effect sizes indicate a better understanding of a phenomenon. Also, our study offers information about research domains for which the investigation of moderating effects may be more fruitful and provide information that is likely to facilitate the implementation of Bayesian analysis. Finally, our study offers information that practitioners can use to evaluate the relative effectiveness of various types of interventions.},

@article{Bourdoukan,
	Abstract = {To predict sensory inputs or control motor trajectories, the brain must constantly learn temporal dynamics based on error feedback. However, it remains unclear how such supervised learning is implemented in biological neural networks. Learning in recurrent spiking networks is notoriously difficult because local changes in connectivity may have an unpredictable effect on the global dynamics. The most commonly used learning rules, such as temporal back-propagation, are not local and thus not biologically plausible. Furthermore, reproducing the Poisson-like statistics of neural responses requires the use of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. Such balance is easily destroyed during learning. Using a top-down approach, we show how networks of integrate-and-fire neurons can learn arbitrary linear dynamical systems by feeding back their error as a feed-forward input. The network uses two types of recurrent connections: fast and slow. The fast connections learn to balance excitation and inhibition using a voltage-based plasticity rule. The slow connections are trained to minimize the error feedback using a current-based Hebbian learning rule. Importantly, the balance maintained by fast connections is crucial to ensure that global error signals are available locally in each neuron, in turn resulting in a local learning rule for the slow connections. This demonstrates that spiking networks can learn complex dynamics using purely local learning rules, using E/I balance as the key rather than an additional constraint. The resulting network implements a given function within the predictive coding scheme, with minimal dimensions and activity.},

We introduce two properties as desirable for a learning agent when in the presence of other learning agents, namely rationality and convergence. We examine existing reinforcement learning algorithms according to these two properties and notice that they fail to simultaneously meet both criteria. We then contribute a new learning algorithm, WoLF policy hillclimbing, that is based on a simple principle: ``learn quickly while losing, slowly while winning.'' The algorithm is proven to be rational and we present empirical results for a number of stochastic games showing the algorithm converges.},

@article{Bowling2002,
	Abstract = {Learning to act in a multiagent environment is a difficult problem since the normal definition of an optimal policy no longer applies. The optimal policy at any moment depends on the policies of the other agents. This creates a situation of learning a moving target. Previous learning algorithms have one of two shortcomings depending on their approach. They either converge to a policy that may not be optimal against the specific opponents' policies, or they may not converge at all. In this article we examine this learning problem in the framework of stochastic games. We look at a number of previous learning algorithms showing how they fail at one of the above criteria. We then contribute a new reinforcement learning technique using a variable learning rate to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we introduce the WoLF principle, ``Win or Learn Fast,'' for varying the learning rate. We examine this technique theoretically, proving convergence in self-play on a restricted class of iterated matrix games. We also present empirical results on a variety of more general stochastic games, in situations of self-play and otherwise, demonstrating the wide applicability of this method.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this four volume series is to make available for college teachers and students samples of important and realistic applications of mathematics which can be covered in undergraduate programs. The goal is to provide illustrations of how modem mathematics is actually employed to solve relevant contemporary problems. Although these independent chapters were prepared primarily for teachers in the general mathematical sciences, they should prove valuable to students, teachers, and research scientists in many of the fields of application as well. Prerequisites for each chapter and suggestions for the teacher are provided. Several of these chapters have been tested in a variety of classroom settings, and all have undergone extensive peer review and revision. Illustrations and exercises are included in most chapters. Some units can be covered in one class, whereas others provide sufficient material for a few weeks of class time. Volume 1 contains 23 chapters and deals with differential equations and, in the last four chapters, problems leading to partial differential equations. Applications are taken from medicine, biology, traffic systems and several other fields. The 14 chapters in Volume 2 are devoted mostly to problems arising in political science, but they also address questions appearing in sociology and ecology. Topics covered include voting systems, weighted voting, proportional representation, coalitional values, and committees. The 14 chapters in Volume 3 emphasize discrete mathematical methods such as those which arise in graph theory, combinatorics, and networks.},

Neural dynamics are determined by voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Coupling between the local networks is introduced via sparse excitatory connectivity. With modulation of this long-range synaptic coupling the system undergoes a transition from independent oscillations to chaotic synchronization. Between these states exists a 'weakly' stable state with epochs of synchronization and complex intermittent desynchronization. This may facilitate adaptive brain function by engendering a diverse repertoire of dynamics and contribute to the genesis of complexity in the EEG.},

	Abstract = {"Neural coding" is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable. Thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. Second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. In contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model. Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured. Third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, while spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. The coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. I conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the informational requirements of cognition.},

	Abstract = {Oscillatory activity in the beta (13\textendash{}30 Hz) frequency band is widespread in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, and becomes prominent in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we develop the hypothesis that the degree of synchronization in this frequency band is a critical factor in gating computation across a population of neurons, with increases in beta band synchrony entailing a loss of information-coding space and hence computational capacity. Task and context drive this dynamic gating, so that for each state there will be an optimal level of network synchrony, and levels lower or higher than this will impair behavioural performance. Thus, both the pathological exaggeration of synchrony, as observed in PD, and the ability of interventions like deep brain stimulation (DBS) to excessively suppress synchrony can potentially lead to impairments in behavioural performance. Indeed, under physiological conditions, the manipulation of computational capacity by beta activity may itself present a mechanism of action selection and maintenance.},

At the single neuron level, gain modulation can arise if the two inputs are subject to a direct multiplicative interaction. Alternatively, these inputs can be summed in a linear manner by the neuron and gain modulation can arise, instead, from a nonlinear input\textendash{}output relationship. We derive a mathematical constraint that can distinguish these two mechanisms even though they can look very similar, provided sufficient data of the appropriate type are available. Previously, it has been shown in coordinate transformation studies that artificial neurons with sigmoid transfer functions can acquire a nonlinear additive form of gain modulation through learning-driven adjustment of synaptic weights. We use the constraint derived for single-neuron studies to compare responses in this network with those of another network model based on a biologically inspired transfer function that can support approximately multiplicative interactions.},

One promising strategy is inspired by human curiosity, requiring the agent to learn to predict the future. In this paper a curiosity-driven agent is extended to use these predictions directly for training. To achieve this, the agent predicts the value function of the next state at any point in time. Subsequently, the consistency of this prediction with the current value function is measured, which is then used as a regularization term in the loss function of the algorithm. Experiments were made on grid-world environments as well as on a 3D navigation task, both with sparse rewards. In the first case the extended agent is able to learn significantly faster than the baselines.},

	Abstract = {Novelty exploration can enhance hippocampal plasticity in animals through dopaminergic neuromodulation arising in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA). This enhancement can outlast the exploration phase by several minutes. Currently, little is known about dopaminergic novelty processing and its relationship to hippocampal function in humans. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, SN/VTA activations in humans were indeed driven by stimulus novelty rather than other forms of stimulus salience such as rareness, negative emotional valence, or targetness of familiar stimuli, whereas hippocampal responses were less selective. SN/VTA novelty responses were scaled according to absolute rather than relative novelty in a given context, unlike adaptive SN/VTA responses recently reported for reward outcome in animal studies. Finally, novelty enhanced learning and perirhinal/parahippocampal processing of familiar items presented in the same context. Thus, the human SN/VTA can code absolute stimulus novelty and might contribute to enhancing learning in the context of novelty.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on carefully engineering environment rewards that are extrinsic to the agent. However, annotating each environment with hand-designed, dense rewards is not scalable, motivating the need for developing reward functions that are intrinsic to the agent. Curiosity is a type of intrinsic reward function which uses prediction error as reward signal. In this paper: (a) We perform the first large-scale study of purely curiosity-driven learning, i.e. without any extrinsic rewards, across 54 standard benchmark environments, including the Atari game suite. Our results show surprisingly good performance, and a high degree of alignment between the intrinsic curiosity objective and the handdesigned extrinsic rewards of many game environments. (b) We investigate the effect of using different feature spaces for computing prediction error and show that random features are sufficient for many popular RL game benchmarks, but learned features appear to generalize better (e.g. to novel game levels in Super Mario Bros.). (c) We demonstrate limitations of the prediction-based rewards in stochastic setups. Game-play videos and code are at https://pathak22.github. io/large-scale-curiosity/.},

	Abstract = {We introduce an exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods that is easy to implement and adds minimal overhead to the computation performed. The bonus is the error of a neural network predicting features of the observations given by a fixed randomly initialized neural network. We also introduce a method to flexibly combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. We find that the random network distillation (RND) bonus combined with this increased flexibility enables significant progress on several hard exploration Atari games. In particular we establish state of the art performance on Montezuma's Revenge, a game famously difficult for deep reinforcement learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves better than average human performance on this game without using demonstrations or having access to the underlying state of the game, and occasionally completes the first level.},

	Abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) are extracellularly recorded signals that describe local neuronal network dynamics. In our experiments, the LFP and MUA, recorded from the same electrode in macaque V1 in response to drifting grating visual stimuli, were evaluated on coarse time-scales (\textasciitilde{}1-5s) and fine time-scales ({$<$} 0.1s) . On coarse time-scales, MUA and the LFP both produced sustained visual responses to optimal and nonoptimal oriented visual stimuli. The sustainedness of the two signals across the population of recording sites was correlated (correlation coefficient \textasciitilde{}0.4). At most recording sites the MUA was at least as sustained as the LFP and significantly more sustained for optimal orientations. In previous literature the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies was found to be more strongly correlated with the LFP than with the MUA due to the lack of sustained response in the MUA signal. Since we found that MUA was as sustained as the LFP, MUA may also be correlated with BOLD. On fine time-scales, we computed the coherence between the LFP and MUA over the frequency range 10-150Hz. The LFP and MUA were weakly but significantly coherent (\textasciitilde{} 0.14) in the gamma-band (20-90Hz). The amount of gamma-band coherence was correlated with the power in the gamma-band of the LFP. The data were consistent with the proposal that the LFP and MUA are generated in a noisy, resonant cortical network.},

It has been theorized gamma oscillations provide a `clock' for precise temporal encoding and `binding' of signals about stimulus features across brain regions. For gamma to function as a `clock' it must be autocoherent: phase and frequency conserved over a period of time. We computed phase and frequency trajectories of gamma-band bursts, using timefrequency analysis of LFPs recorded in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) during visual stimulation. The data were compared with simulations of random networks and clock signals in noise. Gamma-band bursts in LFP data were statistically indistinguishable from those found in filtered broadband noise. Therefore, V1 LFP data did not contain `clock'-like gamma-band signals. We consider possible functions for stochastic gamma-band activity, such as a synchronizing pulse signal.},

Both the quantum and the Markov models are formulated as random walk decision processes, but the probabilistic principles differ between the two approaches. Quantum dynamics describe the evolution of complex valued probability amplitudes over time, whereas Markov models describe the evolution of real valued probabilities over time. Quantum dynamics generate interference effects, which are not possible with Markov models. An interference effect occurs when the probability of the union of two possible paths is smaller than each individual path alone. The choice probabilities and distribution of choice response time for the quantum model are derived, and the predictions are contrasted with the Markov model.},

This research is not concerned with whether the brain is a quantum computer. Instead, it uses quantum theory as a fresh conceptual framework and a coherent set of formal tools for explaining puzzling empirical findings in psychology. In this introduction, we focus on two quantum principles as examples to show why quantum cognition is an appealing new theoretical direction for psychology: complementarity, which suggests that some psychological measures have to be made sequentially and that the context generated by the first measure can influence responses to the next one, producing measurement order effects, and superposition, which suggests that some psychological states cannot be defined with respect to definite values but, instead, that all possible values within the superposition have some potential for being expressed. We present evidence showing how these two principles work together to provide a coherent explanation for many divergent and puzzling phenomena in psychology.},

	Abstract = {Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during ``off-line'' states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, ``p-ripples,'' which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. VC 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent corticobasal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.

	Abstract = {The Network of Noisy Leaky Integrate and Fire (NNLIF) model describes the behavior of a neural network at mesoscopic level. It is one of the simplest self-contained mean-field models considered for that purpose. Even so, to study the mathematical properties of the model some simplifications were necessary [4, 5, 6], which disregard crucial phenomena. In this work we deal with the general NNLIF model without simplifications. It involves a network with two populations (excitatory and inhibitory), with transmission delays between the neurons and where the neurons remain in a refractory state for a certain time. We have studied the number of steady states in terms of the model parameters, the long time behaviour via the entropy method and Poincar\textasciiacute{}e's inequality, blow-up phenomena, and the importance of transmission delays between excitatory neurons to prevent blow-up and to give rise to synchronous solutions. Besides analytical results, we have presented a numerical resolutor for this model, based on high order flux-splitting WENO schemes and an explicit third order TVD Runge-Kutta method, in order to describe the wide range of phenomena exhibited by the network: blow-up, asynchronous/synchronous solutions and instability/stability of the steady states; the solver also allows us to observe the time evolution of the firing rates, refractory states and the probability distributions of the excitatory and inhibitory populations.},

@article{Calhoun2014,
	Abstract = {Animals have evolved intricate search strategies to find new sources of food. Here, we analyze a complex food seeking behavior in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to derive a general theory describing different searches. We show that C. elegans, like many other animals, uses a multi-stage search for food, where they initially explore a small area intensively (`local search') before switching to explore a much larger area (`global search'). We demonstrate that these search strategies as well as the transition between them can be quantitatively explained by a maximally informative search strategy, where the searcher seeks to continuously maximize information about the target. Although performing maximally informative search is computationally demanding, we show that a drift-diffusion model can approximate it successfully with just three neurons. Our study reveals how the maximally informative search strategy can be implemented and adopted to different search conditions.
          , 
            How an animal forages for food can make the difference between life and death, and there are several different searching strategies that may be adopted. Foraging could be more productive if animals could take into account any of the patterns with which food is distributed in their environment, but how much could they measure and memorize? Calhoun et al. show that a tiny worm called Caenorhabditis elegans can keep track of how its previous food finds were spread out, and uses this knowledge to optimize future searches for food.
            When C. elegans forages, it begins by performing an intensive search of where it believes food is likely to be found. This strategy, called `local search', is characterised by the worm making numerous sharp turns that keep it in its target search area. If the worm has not found food after 15 min, it abruptly switches its behavior to a so-called `global search' strategy, which features fewer sharp turns and more forays into the surrounding area.
            C. elegans is often thought to follow the smell of a food source in order to locate it. While reliable on small scale, this strategy can prove problematic when the distribution of food is patchy. Calhoun et al. show that in extreme conditions, such as when food is completely removed, the animals determine where and for how long to persist with their search based on their knowledge of what was typical of their environment. Such a strategy is called infotaxis, which literally means `guided by information'. While the neural circuits underpinning these behaviors remain to be found, Calhoun et al. propose a model that suggests that these circuits could be relatively simple, and made up of as few as three neurons.},

Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans evaluates variability in its food environment and modifies its future behavior accordingly. We derive a behavioral model that reveals a critical period over which information about the food environment is acquired and predicts future search behavior. We also identify a pair of high-threshold sensory neurons that encode variability in food concentration and the downstream dopamine-dependent circuit that generates appropriate search behavior upon removal from food. Further, we show that CREB is required in a subset of interneurons and determines the timescale over which the variability is integrated. Interestingly, the variability circuit is a subset of a larger circuit driving search behavior, showing that learning directly modifies the very same neurons driving behavior. Our study reveals how a neural circuit decodes environmental variability to generate contextually appropriate decisions.},

	Abstract = {In `experience-weighted attraction' {\v Z}EWA. learning, strategies have attractions that reflect initial predispositions, are updated based on payoff experience, and determine choice probabilities according to some rule {\v Z}e.g., logit.. A key feature is a parameter ? that weights the strength of hypothetical reinforcement of strategies that were not chosen according to the payoff they would have yielded, relative to reinforcement of chosen strategies according to received payoffs. The other key features are two discount rates, ␾ and ␳, which separately discount previous attractions, and an experience weight. EWA includes reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play {\v Z}belief learning. as special cases, and hybridizes their key elements. When ? s 0 and ␳ s 0, cumulative choice reinforcement results. When ? s 1 and ␳ s ␾, levels of reinforcement of strategies are exactly the same as expected payoffs given weighted fictitious play beliefs. Using three sets of experimental data, parameter estimates of the model were calibrated on part of the data and used to predict a holdout sample. Estimates of ? are generally around .50, ␾ around .8᎐1, and ␳ varies from 0 to ␾. Reinforcement and belief-learning special cases are generally rejected in favor of EWA, though belief models do better in some constant-sum games. EWA is able to combine the best features of previous approaches, allowing attractions to begin and grow flexibly as choice reinforcement does, but reinforcing unchosen strategies substantially as belief-based models implicitly do.},

	Abstract = {Coupled loops with time delays are common in physiological systems such as neural networks. We study a Hopfield-type network that consists of a pair of one-way loops each with three neurons and two-way coupling (of either excitatory or inhibitory type) between a single neuron of each loop. Time delays are introduced in the connections between loops, and the effects of coupling strengths and delays on the network dynamics are investigated. These effects depend strongly on whether the coupling is symmetric (of the same type in both directions) or asymmetric (inhibitory in one direction and excitatory in the other). The network of six delay differential equations is studied by linear stability analysis and bifurcation theory. Loops having inherently stable zero solutions cannot be destabilized by weak coupling, regardless of the delay. Asymmetric coupling is weakly stabilizing but easily upset by delays. Symmetric coupling (if not too weak) can destabilize an inherently stable zero solution, leading to nontrivial fixed points if the gain of the neuron response function is not too negative or to oscillation otherwise. In the oscillation case, intermediate delays can restabilize the zero solution. At the borderline of the weak coupling region (symmetric or asymmetric), stability can change with delay ranges. When the coupling strengths are of the same magnitude, the oscillations of corresponding neurons in the two loops can be in phase, antiphase (symmetric coupling), or one quarter period out of phase (asymmetric coupling) depending on the delay.},

	Abstract = {Computational models are increasingly important for studying complex neurophysiological systems. As scientific tools, it is essential that such models can be reproduced and critically evaluated by a range of scientists. However, published models are currently implemented using a diverse set of modeling approaches, simulation tools, and computer languages making them inaccessible and difficult to reproduce. Models also typically contain concepts that are tightly linked to domain-specific simulators, or depend on knowledge that is described exclusively in text-based documentation. To address these issues we have developed a compact, hierarchical, XML-based language called LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification), that can define the structure and dynamics of a wide range of biological models in a fully machine readable format. We describe how LEMS underpins the latest version of NeuroML and show that this framework can define models of ion channels, synapses, neurons and networks. Unit handling, often a source of error when reusing models, is built into the core of the language by specifying physical quantities in models in terms of the base dimensions. We show how LEMS, together with the open source Java and Python based libraries we have developed, facilitates the generation of scripts for multiple neuronal simulators and provides a route for simulator free code generation. We establish that LEMS can be used to define models from systems biology and map them to neuroscience-domain specific simulators, enabling models to be shared between these traditionally separate disciplines. LEMS and NeuroML 2 provide a new, comprehensive framework for defining computational models of neuronal and other biological systems in a machine readable format, making them more reproducible and increasing the transparency and accessibility of their underlying structure and properties.},

	Abstract = {Homeostatic processes that provide negative feedback to regulate neuronal firing rates are essential for normal brain function. Indeed, multiple parameters of individual neurons, including the scale of afferent synapse strengths and the densities of specific ion channels, have been observed to change on homeostatic time scales to oppose the effects of chronic changes in synaptic input. This raises the question of whether these processes are controlled by a single slow feedback variable or multiple slow variables. A single homeostatic process providing negative feedback to a neuron's firing rate naturally maintains a stable homeostatic equilibrium with a characteristic mean firing rate; but the conditions under which multiple slow feedbacks produce a stable homeostatic equilibrium have not yet been explored. Here we study a highly general model of homeostatic firing rate control in which two slow variables provide negative feedback to drive a firing rate toward two different target rates. Using dynamical systems techniques, we show that such a control system can be used to stably maintain a neuron's characteristic firing rate mean and variance in the face of perturbations, and we derive conditions under which this happens. We also derive expressions that clarify the relationship between the homeostatic firing rate targets and the resulting stable firing rate mean and variance. We provide specific examples of neuronal systems that can be effectively regulated by dual homeostasis. One of these examples is a recurrent excitatory network, which a dual feedback system can robustly tune to serve as an integrator.},

	Abstract = {Working memory function declines across the lifespan. Computational models of aging attribute such memory impairments to reduced distinctiveness between neural representations of different mental states in old age, a phenomenon termed dedifferentiation. These models predict that neural distinctiveness should be reduced uniformly across experimental conditions in older adults. In contrast, the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) model predicts that the distinctiveness of neural representations should be increased in older adults (relative to young adults) at low levels of task demand but reduced at high levels of demand. The present study used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure the effects of age and task demands on the distinctiveness of the neural representations of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Neural distinctiveness was estimated separately for memory encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, and for low, medium, and high memory loads. Results from sensory cortex during encoding and retrieval were consistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis: distinctiveness of visual cortical representations during these phases was uniformly reduced in older adults, irrespective of memory load. However, maintenance-related responses in prefrontal and parietal regions yielded a strikingly different pattern of results. At low loads, older adults showed higher distinctiveness than younger adults; at high loads, this pattern reversed, such that distinctiveness was higher in young adults. This interaction between age group and memory load is at odds with the dedifferentiation hypothesis but consistent with CRUNCH. In sum, our results provide partial support for both dedifferentiation- and compensation-based models; we argue that comprehensive theories of cognitive aging must incorporate aspects of both models to fully explain complex patterns of age-related neuro-cognitive change.},

	Abstract = {A reservoir computer is a dynamical system that may be used to perform computations. A reservoir computer usually consists of a set of nonlinear nodes coupled together in a network so that there are feedback paths. Training the reservoir computer consists of inputing a signal of interest and fitting the time series signals of the reservoir computer nodes to a training signal that is related to the input signal. It is believed that dynamical systems function most efficiently as computers at the "edge of chaos", the point at which the largest Lyapunov exponent of the dynamical system transitions from negative to positive. In this work I simulate several different reservoir computers and ask if the best performance really does come at this edge of chaos. I find that while it is possible to get optimum performance at the edge of chaos, there may also be parameter values where the edge of chaos regime produces poor performance. This ambiguous parameter dependance has implications for building reservoir computers from analog physical systems, where the parameter range is restricted.},

	Abstract = {Ultimately, whether or not a neuron produces a spike determines its contribution to local computations. In response to brief stimuli the probability a neuron will fire can be described by its input-output function, which depends on the net balance and timing of excitatory and inhibitory currents. While excitatory and inhibitory synapses are plastic, most studies examine plasticity of subthreshold events. Thus, the effects of concerted regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength on neuronal inputoutput functions are not well understood. Here, theoretical analyses reveal that excitatory synaptic strength controls the threshold of the neuronal input-output function, while inhibitory plasticity alters the threshold and gain. Experimentally, changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons also altered their inputoutput function as predicted by the model. These results support the existence of two functional modes of plasticity that can be used to optimize information processing: threshold and gain plasticity.},

Previous models assume that these neurons receive the highest weighted input from an ensemble encoding the preferred stimulus, but dendrites enable other possibilities. Non-linear dendritic processing can produce stimulus selectivity based on the spatial distribution of synapses, even if the total preferred stimulus weight does not exceed that of non-preferred stimuli. Using a multi-subunit non-linear model, we demonstrate that selectivity can arise from the spatial distribution of synapses.},

	Abstract = {Local supra-linear summation of excitatory inputs occurring in pyramidal cell dendrites, the so-called dendritic spikes, results in independent spiking dendritic sub-units, which turn pyramidal neurons into two-layer neural networks capable of computing linearly non-separable functions, such as the exclusive OR. Other neuron classes, such as interneurons, may possess only a few independent dendritic sub-units, or only passive dendrites where input summation is purely sub-linear, and where dendritic sub-units are only saturating. To determine if such neurons can also compute linearly non-separable functions, we enumerate, for a given parameter range, the Boolean functions implementable by a binary neuron model with a linear sub-unit and either a single spiking or a saturating dendritic sub-unit. We then analytically generalize these numerical results to an arbitrary number of non-linear sub-units. First, we show that a single non-linear dendritic sub-unit, in addition to the somatic non-linearity, is sufficient to compute linearly non-separable functions. Second, we analytically prove that, with a sufficient number of saturating dendritic sub-units, a neuron can compute all functions computable with purely excitatory inputs. Third, we show that these linearly non-separable functions can be implemented with at least two strategies: one where a dendritic sub-unit is sufficient to trigger a somatic spike; another where somatic spiking requires the cooperation of multiple dendritic sub-units. We formally prove that implementing the latter architecture is possible with both types of dendritic sub-units whereas the former is only possible with spiking dendrites. Finally, we show how linearly non-separable functions can be computed by a generic two-compartment biophysical model and a realistic neuron model of the cerebellar stellate cell interneuron. Taken together our results demonstrate that passive dendrites are sufficient to enable neurons to compute linearly non-separable functions.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, multivariate pattern analyses have been performed on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, permitting prediction of mental states from local patterns of blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across voxels [1, 2]. We previously demonstrated that it is possible to predict the position of individuals in a virtualreality environment from the pattern of activity across voxels in the hippocampus [3]. Although this shows that spatial memories can be decoded, substantially more challenging, and arguably only possible to investigate in humans [4], is whether it is feasible to predict which complex everyday experience, or episodic memory, a person is recalling. Here we document for the first time that traces of individual rich episodic memories are detectable and distinguishable solely from the pattern of fMRI BOLD signals across voxels in the human hippocampus. In so doing, we uncovered a possible functional topography in the hippocampus, with preferential episodic processing by some hippocampal regions over others. Moreover, our results imply that the neuronal traces of episodic memories are stable (and thus predictable) even over many re-activations. Finally, our data provide further evidence for functional differentiation within the medial temporal lobe, in that we show the hippocampus contains significantly more episodic information than adjacent structures.},

	Abstract = {Gamma oscillations are thought to be critical for a number of behavioral functions, they occur in many regions of the brain and through a variety of mechanisms. Fast repetitive bursting (FRB) neurons in layer 2 of the cortex are able to drive gamma oscillations over long periods of time. Even though the oscillation is driven by FRB neurons, strong feedback within the rest of the cortex must modulate properties of the oscillation such as frequency and power. We used a highly detailed model of the cortex to determine how a cohort of 33 parameters controlling synaptic drive might modulate gamma oscillation properties. We were interested in determining not just the effects of parameters individually, but we also wanted to reveal interactions between parameters beyond additive effects. To prevent a combinatorial explosion in parameter combinations that might need to be simulated, we used a fractional factorial design (FFD) that estimated the effects of individual parameters and two parameter interactions. This experiment required only 4096 model runs. We found that the largest effects on both gamma power and frequency came from a complex interaction between efficacy of synaptic connections from layer 2 inhibitory neurons to layer 2 excitatory neurons and the parameter for the reciprocal connection. As well as the effect of the individual parameters determining synaptic efficacy, there was an interaction between these parameters beyond the additive effects of the parameters alone. The magnitude of this effect was similar to that of the individual parameters, predicting that it is physiologically important in setting gamma oscillation properties.},

	Abstract = {Models of complex heterogeneous systems like the brain are inescapably incomplete, and thus always falsified with enough data. As neural data grow in volume and complexity, absolute measures of adequacy are being replaced by model selection methods that rank the relative accuracy of competing theories. Selection still depends on incomplete mathematical instantiations, but the implicit expectation is that ranking is robust to their details. Here we highlight a contrary finding of ``brittleness,'' where data matching one theory conceptually are ranked closer to an instance of another. In particular, selection between recent models of decision making is conceptually misleading when data are simulated with minor distributional mismatch, with mixed secondary signals, or with non-stationary parameters; and decision-related responses in macaque cortex show features suggesting that these effects may impact empirical results. We conclude with recommendations to mitigate such brittleness when using model selection to study neural signals.},

Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell's firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems.},

Clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems can be programmed with thousands of different stimulation parameter combinations (e.g. electrode contact(s), voltage, pulse width, frequency). Our goal was to develop novel computational tools to characterize the effects of stimulation parameter adjustment for DBS. Approach. The volume of tissue activated (VTA) represents a metric used to estimate the spatial extent of DBS for a given parameter setting. Traditional methods for calculating the VTA rely on activation function (AF)-based approaches and tend to overestimate the neural response when stimulation is applied through multiple electrode contacts. Therefore, we created a new method for VTA calculation that relied on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Main results. The ANN-based predictor provides more accurate descriptions of the spatial spread of activation compared to AF-based approaches for monopolar stimulation. In addition, the ANN was able to accurately estimate the VTA in response to multi-contact electrode configurations. Significance. The ANN-based approach may represent a useful method for fast computation of the VTA in situations with limited computational resources, such as a clinical DBS programming application on a tablet computer.},

A hierarchy of timescales naturally emerges from this system: sensory areas show brief, transient responses to input (appropriate for sensory processing), whereas association areas integrate inputs over time and exhibit persistent activity (suitable for decision-making and working memory). The model displays multiple temporal hierarchies, as evidenced by contrasting responses to visual versus somatosensory stimulation. Moreover, slower prefrontal and temporal areas have a disproportionate impact on global brain dynamics. These findings establish a circuit mechanism for ``temporal receptive windows'' that are progressively enlarged along the cortical hierarchy, suggest an extension of time integration in decision making from local to large circuits, and should prompt a reevaluation of the analysis of functional connectivity (measured by fMRI or electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) by taking into account interareal heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {The power spectrum of brain electric field potential recordings is dominated by an arrhythmic broadband signal but a mechanistic account of its underlying neural network dynamics is lacking. Here we show how the broadband power spectrum of field potential recordings can be explained by a simple random network of nodes near criticality. Such a recurrent network produces activity with a combination of a fast and a slow autocorrelation time constant, with the fast mode corresponding to local dynamics and the slow mode resulting from recurrent excitatory connections across the network. These modes are combined to produce a power spectrum similar to that observed in human intracranial EEG (i.e., electrocorticography, ECoG) recordings. Moreover, such a network naturally converts input correlations across nodes into temporal autocorrelation of the network activity. Consequently, increased independence between nodes results in a reduction in low-frequency power, which offers a possible explanation for observed changes in ECoG power spectra during task performance. Lastly, changes in network coupling produce changes in network activity power spectra reminiscent of those seen in human ECoG recordings across different arousal states. This model thus links macroscopic features of the empirical ECoG power spectrum to a parsimonious underlying network structure and proposes potential mechanisms for changes in ECoG power spectra observed across behavioral and arousal states. This provides a computational framework within which to generate and test hypotheses about the cellular and network mechanisms underlying whole brain electrical dynamics, their variations across behavioral states as well as abnormalities associated with brain diseases.},

	Abstract = {Brain activity shows phase\textendash{}amplitude coupling between its slow and fast oscillatory components. We study phase\textendash{}amplitude coupling as recorded at individual sites, using a modified version of the well-known Wendling neural mass model. To the population of fast inhibitory interneurons of this model, we added external modulatory input and dynamic self-feedback. These two modifications together are sufficient to let the inhibitory population serve as a limit-cycle oscillator, with frequency characteristics comparable to the beta and gamma bands. The frequency and power of these oscillations can be tuned through the time constant of the dynamic and modulatory input. Alpha band activity is generated, as is usual in such models, as a result of interactions of pyramidal neurons and a population of slow inhibitory interneurons. The slow inhibitory population activity directly influences the fast oscillations via the synaptic gain between slow and fast inhibitory populations. As a result, the amplitude envelope of the fast oscillation is coupled to the phase of the slow activity; this result is consistent with the notion that phase\textendash{}amplitude coupling is effectuated by interactions between inhibitory interneurons.},

The mechanism by which neurons process the coding of signals is not well understood. Here, we propose that coincidence detection, one of the ways to describe the functionality of a single neural cell, can improve the reliability and the precision of signal detection through detection of presynaptic input synchrony. Using a simplified neuronal network model composed of dozens of integrate-and-fire neurons and a single coincidence-detector neuron, we show how the network reads out the subthreshold noisy signals reliably and precisely. We find suitable pairing parameters, the threshold and the detection time window of the coincidence-detector neuron, that optimize the precision and reliability of the neuron. Furthermore, it is observed that the refractory period induces an oscillation in the spontaneous firing, but the neuron can inhibit this activity and improve the reliability and precision further. In the case of intermediate intrinsic states of the input neuron, the network responds to the input more efficiently. These results present the critical link between spiking synchrony and noisy signal transfer, which is utilized in coincidence detection, resulting in enhancement of temporally sensitive coding scheme.},

This view will have various implications for NNs, e.g. providing an explanation for why convergence problems arise in NNs, and it gives rough guidance on avoiding overfitting. In addition, we use this phenomenon to predict and confirm a multicollinearity property of NNs not previously reported in the literature. Most importantly, given this loose correspondence, one may choose to routinely use polynomial models instead of NNs, thus avoiding some major problems of the latter, such as having to set many tuning parameters and dealing with convergence issues. We present a number of empirical results; in each case, the accuracy of the polynomial approach matches or exceeds that of NN approaches.

Some of these neurons (parietal mirror neurons) show a similar selectivity also during the observation of the same action sequences when executed by others. Thus, it appears that the neuronal response occurring during the execution and the observation of a specific grasping act codes not only the executed motor act, but also the agent's final goal (intention). In this work we present a biologically inspired neural network architecture that models mechanisms of motor sequences execution and recognition. In this network, pools composed of motor and mirror neurons that encode motor acts of a sequence are arranged in form of action goal-specific neuronal chains. The execution and the recognition of actions is achieved through the propagation of activity bursts along specific chains modulated by visual and somatosensory inputs. The implemented spiking neuron network is able to reproduce the results found in neurophysiological recordings of parietal neurons during task performance and provides a biologically plausible implementation of the action selection and recognition process. Finally, the present paper proposes a mechanism for the formation of new neural chains by linking together in a sequential manner neurons that represent subsequent motor acts, thus producing goal-directed sequences.},

In experiments with neural networks, we show that a surprisingly large number of models can be effectively stored within a single parameter instance. Furthermore, each of these models can undergo thousands of training steps without significantly interfering with other models within the superposition. This approach may be viewed as the online complement of compression: rather than reducing the size of a network after training, we make use of the unrealized capacity of a network during training.},

We propose that evolution was likely to have optimized neural circuits to minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of ``wire'' used to construct circuits, and to have maximized the density of synapses. Here we ask the question: ``What fraction of the volume should be taken up by axons and dendrites (i.e., wire) when these variables are at their optimal values?'' The biophysical properties of axons and dendrites dictate that wire should occupy 3/5 of the volume in an optimally wired gray matter. We have measured the fraction of the volume occupied by each cellular component and find that the volume of wire is close to the predicted optimal value.},

	Abstract = {Abnormalities in GABAergic interneurons, particularly fast-spiking interneurons (FSINs) that generate gamma (g; \$30\textendash{}120 Hz) oscillations, are hypothesized to disrupt prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent cognition in schizophrenia. Although g rhythms are abnormal in schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether they directly influence cognition. Mechanisms underlying schizophrenia's typical postadolescent onset also remain elusive. We addressed these issues using mice heterozygous for Dlx5/6, which regulate GABAergic interneuron development. In Dlx5/6+/{\`A} mice, FSINs become abnormal following adolescence, coinciding with the onset of cognitive inflexibility and deficient task-evoked g oscillations. Inhibiting PFC interneurons in control mice reproduced these deficits, whereas stimulating them at g-frequencies restored cognitive flexibility in adult Dlx5/6+/{\`A} mice. These pro-cognitive effects were frequency specific and persistent. These findings elucidate a mechanism whereby abnormal FSIN development may contribute to the post-adolescent onset of schizophrenia endophenotypes. Furthermore, they demonstrate a causal, potentially therapeutic, role for PFC interneuron-driven g oscillations in cognitive domains at the core of schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of recovering the underlying reward function from the behavior of an expert. Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert's behavior, namely the case in which the expert's policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert's trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings.},

	Abstract = {We report the observation of a novel and non-trivial synchronization state in a system consisting of three oscillators coupled in a linear chain. For certain ranges of coupling strength the weakly coupled oscillator pair exhibits phase synchronization while the strongly coupled oscillator pair does not. This intriguing "weak-winner" synchronization phenomenon can be explained by the interplay between non-isochronicity and natural frequency of the oscillator, as coupling strength is varied. Further, we present sufficient conditions under which the weak-winner phase synchronization can occur for limit cycle as well as chaotic oscillators. Employing model system from ecology as well as a paradigmatic model from physics, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is a generic feature for a large class of coupled oscillator systems. The realization of this peculiar yet quite generic weak-winner dynamics can have far reaching consequences in a wide range of scientific disciplines that deal with the phenomenon of phase synchronization. Our results also highlight the role of non-isochronicity (shear) as a fundamental feature of an oscillator in shaping the emergent dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Movements are universally, sometimes frustratingly, variable. When such variability causes error, we typically assume that something went wrong during the movement. The same assumption is made by recent and influential models of motor control. These posit that the principal limit on repeatable performance is neuromuscular noise that corrupts movement as it occurs. An alternative hypothesis is that movement variability arises before movements begin, during motor preparation. We examined this possibility directly by recording the preparatory activity of single cortical neurons during a highly practiced reach task. Small variations in preparatory neural activity were predictive of small variations in the upcoming reach. Effect magnitudes were such that at least half of the observed movement variability likely had its source during motor preparation. Thus, even for a highly practiced task, the ability to repeatedly plan the same movement limits our ability to repeatedly execute the same movement.},

	Abstract = {The motor cortices are active during both movement and movement preparation. A common assumption is that preparatory activity constitutes a subthreshold form of movement activity: a neuron active during rightward movements becomes modestly active during preparation of a rightward movement. We asked whether this pattern of activity is, in fact, observed. We found that it was not: at the level of a single neuron, preparatory tuning was weakly correlated with movement-period tuning. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, preparatory tuning could be captured by a preferred direction in an abstract ``space'' that described the population-level pattern of movement activity. In fact, this relationship accounted for preparatory responses better than did traditional tuning models. These results are expected if preparatory activity provides the initial state of a dynamical system whose evolution produces movement activity. Our results thus suggest that preparatory activity may not represent specific factors, and may instead play a more mechanistic role.},

It is argued that sufficient data exist to make this approach possible, and that the result can more effectively delineate the true biological categories of neurophysiological mechanisms than do approaches based on definitions of putative functions inherited from psychological traditions. As an example, the approach is used to sketch a theoretical framework of how basic feedback control of interaction with the world was elaborated during vertebrate evolution, to give rise to the functional architecture of the mammalian brain. The results provide a conceptual taxonomy of mechanisms that naturally map to neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data and that offer a context for defining putative functions that, it is argued, are better grounded in biology than are some of the traditional concepts of cognitive science.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing distributed patterns of brain activation using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a popular approach for using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict mental states. While the majority of studies currently build separate classifiers for each participant in the sample, in principle a single classifier can be derived from and tested on data from all participants. These two approaches, within- and cross-participant classification, rely on potentially different sources of variability and thus may provide distinct information about brain function. Here, we used both approaches to identify brain regions that contain information about passively received monetary rewards (i.e., images of currency that influenced participant payment) and social rewards (i.e., images of human faces). Our withinparticipant analyses implicated regions in the ventral visual processing stream\textemdash{}including fusiform gyrus and primary visual cortex\textemdash{}and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Two key results indicate these regions may contain statistically discriminable patterns that contain different informational representations. First, cross-participant analyses implicated additional brain regions, including striatum and anterior insula. The cross-participant analyses also revealed systematic changes in predictive power across brain regions, with the pattern of change consistent with the functional properties of regions. Second, individual differences in classifier performance in VMPFC were related to individual differences in preferences between our two reward modalities. We interpret these results as reflecting a distinction between patterns showing participant-specific functional organization and those indicating aspects of brain organization that generalize across individuals.},

	Abstract = {Thalamic inputs of layer 4 (L4) cells in sensory cortices are outnumbered by local connections. Thus, it was suggested that robust sensory response in L4 emerges due to synchronized thalamic activity. In order to investigate the role of both inputs in generation of cortical synchronization, we isolated the thalamic excitatory inputs of cortical cells by optogenetically silencing cortical firing. In anesthetized mice, we measured the correlation between isolated thalamic synaptic inputs of simultaneously patched nearby L4 cells of the barrel cortex. In contrast to correlated activity of excitatory synaptic inputs in the intact cortex, isolated thalamic inputs exhibit lower variability and asynchronous spontaneous and sensory evoked inputs. These results were further supported in awake mice when we recorded the excitatory inputs of individual cortical cells simultaneously with the local field potential (LFP) in a nearby site. Our results therefore indicate that cortical synchronization emerges by intracortical coupling.},

	Abstract = {In open-ended and changing environments, agents face a wide range of potential tasks that might not come with associated reward functions. Such autonomous learning agents must set their own tasks and build their own curriculum through an intrinsically motivated exploration. Because some tasks might prove easy and some impossible, agents must actively select which task to practice at any given moment, to maximize their overall mastery on the set of learnable tasks. This paper proposes CURIOUS, an algorithm that leverages: 1) an extension of Universal Value Function Approximators to achieve, within a unique policy, multiple tasks, each parameterized by multiple goals and 2) an automated curriculum learning mechanism that biases the attention of the agent towards tasks maximizing the absolute learning progress. Agents focus on achievable tasks first, and focus back on tasks that are being forgotten. Experiments conducted in a new multi-task multigoal robotic environment show that our algorithm benefits from these two ideas and demonstrate properties of robustness to distracting tasks, forgetting and changes in body properties.},

	Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with abnormal beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) in the basal ganglia and motor cortex (M1). Recent reports show that M1 beta-high gamma (50-200 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is exaggerated in PD and is reduced following acute deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here we analyze invasive M1 electrocorticography recordings in PD patients on and off DBS, and in isolated cervical dystonia patients, and show that M1 beta oscillations are nonsinusoidal, having sharp and asymmetric features. These sharp oscillatory beta features underlie the previously reported PAC, providing an alternative to the standard interpretation of PAC as an interaction between two distinct frequency components. Specifically, the ratio between peak and trough sharpness is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma PAC (r = 0.96) and predicts PD-related motor deficit. Using a simulation of the local field potential, we demonstrate that sharp oscillatory waves can arise from synchronous synaptic activity. We propose that exaggerated beta-high gamma PAC may actually reflect such synchronous synaptic activity, manifesting as sharp beta oscillations that are ``smoothed out'' with DBS. These results support the ``desynchronization'' hypothesis of DBS wherein DBS counteracts pathological synchronization throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. We argue that PAC can be influenced by more than one mechanism. In this case synaptic synchrony, rather than the often assumed spike-field coherence, may underlie exaggerated PAC. These often overlooked temporal features of the oscillatory waveform carry critical physiological information about neural processes and dynamics that may lead to better understanding of underlying neuropathology.},

	Abstract = {Brain rhythms are nearly always analyzed in the spectral domain in terms of their power, phase, and frequency. While this conventional approach has uncovered spike-field coupling, as well as correlations to normal behaviors and pathological states, emerging work has highlighted the physiological and behavioral importance of multiple novel oscillation features. Oscillatory bursts, for example, uniquely index a variety of cognitive states, and the nonsinusoidal shape of oscillations relate to physiological changes, including Parkinson's disease. Open questions remain regarding how bursts and nonsinusoidal features relate to circuit-level processes, and how they interrelate. By analyzing unit and local field recordings in the rodent hippocampus, we uncover a number of significant relationships between oscillatory bursts, nonsinusoidal waveforms, and local inhibitory and excitatory spiking patterns. Bursts of theta oscillations are surprisingly related to a decrease in pyramidal neuron synchrony, and have no detectable effect on firing sequences, despite significant increases in neuronal firing rates during periods of theta bursting. Theta burst duration is predicted by the asymmetries of its first cycle, and cycle asymmetries relate to firing rate, synchrony, and sequences of pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These results provide compelling physiological evidence that time-domain features, of both nonsinusoidal hippocampal theta waveform and the theta bursting state, reflects local circuit properties. These results point to the possibility of inferring circuit states from local field potential features in the hippocampus and perhaps other brain regions with other rhythms.},

	Abstract = {Two potential bottlenecks on the expressiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are their ability to store information about the task in their parameters, and to store information about the input history in their units. We show experimentally that all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit. We further find that for several tasks it is the per-task parameter capacity bound that determines performance. These results suggest that many previous results comparing RNN architectures are driven primarily by differences in training effectiveness, rather than differences in capacity. Supporting this observation, we compare training difficulty for several architectures, and show that vanilla RNNs are far more difficult to train, yet have higher capacity. Finally, we propose two novel RNN architectures, one of which is easier to train than the LSTM or GRU.},

	Abstract = {The Hodgkin-Huxley equations for space-clamped squid axon (18'C) have been modified to approximate voltage clamp data from repetitive-firing crustacean walking leg axons and activity in response to constant current stimulation has been computed. The ino and h. parameters of the sodium conductance system were shifted along the voltage axis in opposite directions so that their relative overlap was increased approximately 7 mV. Time constants, Tm and Th, were moved in a similar manner. Voltage-dependent parameters of delayed potassium conductance, n,O and T, were shifted 4.3 mV in the positive direction and Tr was uniformly increased by a factor of 2. Leakage conductance and capacitance were unchanged. Repetitive activity of this modified circuit was qualitatively similar to that of the standard model. A fifth branch was added to the circuit representing a transient potassium conductance system present in the repetitive walking leg axons and in other repetitive neurons. This model, with various parameter choices, fired repetitively down to approximately 2 spikes/s and up to 350/s. The frequency vs. stimulus current plot could be fit well by a straight line over a decade of the low frequency range and the general appearance of the spike trains was similar to that of other repetitive neurons. Stimulus intensities were of the same order as those which produce repetitive activity in the standard Hodgkin-Huxley axon. The repetitive firing rate and first spike latency (utilization time) were found to be most strongly influenced by the inactivation time constant of the transient potassium conductance (TB), the delayed potassium conductance (Tn), and the value of leakage conductance (ga. The model presents a mechanism by which stable low frequency discharge can be generated by millisecondorder membrane conductance changes.},

	Abstract = {It is well recognised that patients with Parkinson's disease exhibit cognitive deficits, even in the earliest disease stages. Whereas, L-DOPA therapy in early Parkinson's disease is accepted to improve the motor symptoms, the effects on cognitive performance are more complex: both positive and negative effects have been observed. The purpose of the present article is to review the effects of L-DOPA medication in Parkinson's disease on cognitive functions in the broad domains of cognitive flexibility and working memory. The review places the effects in Parkinson's disease within a framework of evidence from studies with healthy human volunteers, rodents and non-human primates as well as computational modeling work. It is suggested that beneficial or detrimental effects of L-DOPA are observed depending on task demands and basal dopamine levels in distinct parts of the striatum. The study of the beneficial and detrimental cognitive effects of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease has substantial implications for the understanding and treatment development of cognitive abnormalities in Parkinson's disease as well as normal health.},

	Abstract = {Neural field models of firing rate activity have had a major impact in helping to develop an understanding of the dynamics seen in brain slice preparations. These models typically take the form of integrodifferential equations. Their non-local nature has led to the development of a set of analytical and numerical tools for the study of waves, bumps and patterns, based around natural extensions of those used for local differential equation models. In this paper we present a review of such techniques and show how recent advances have opened the way for future studies of neural fields in both one and two dimensions that can incorporate realistic forms of axo-dendritic interactions and the slow intrinsic currents that underlie bursting behaviour in single neurons.},

	Abstract = {Human behavioral response timing is highly variable from trial to trial. While it is generally understood that behavioral variability must be due to trial-by-trial variations in brain function, it is still largely unknown which physiological mechanisms govern the timing of neural activity as it travels through networks of neuronal populations, and how variations in the timing of neural activity relate to variations in the timing of behavior. In our study, we submitted recordings from the cortical surface to novel analytic techniques to chart the trajectory of neuronal population activity across the human cortex in single trials, and found joint modulation of the timing of this activity and of consequent behavior by neuronal oscillations in the alpha band (8\textendash{}12 Hz). Specifically, we established that the onset of population activity tends to occur during the trough of oscillatory activity, and that deviations from this preferred relationship are related to changes in the timing of population activity and the speed of the resulting behavioral response. These results indicate that neuronal activity incurs variable delays as it propagates across neuronal populations, and that the duration of each delay is a function of the instantaneous phase of oscillatory activity. We conclude that the results presented in this paper are supportive of a general model for variability in the effective speed of information transmission in the human brain and for variability in the timing of human behavior.},

	Abstract = {Although slow waves of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been associated with attentional processes, the functional significance of the alpha component in the EEG (8.1\textendash{}12 Hz) remains uncertain. Conventionally, synchronisation in the alpha frequency range is taken to be a marker of cognitive inactivity, i.e. `cortical idling'. However, it has been suggested that alpha may index the active inhibition of sensory information during internally directed attentional tasks such as mental imagery. More recently, this idea has been amended to encompass the notion of alpha synchronisation as a means of inhibition of non-task relevant cortical areas irrespective of the direction of attention. Here we test the adequacy of the one idling and two inhibition hypotheses about alpha. In two experiments we investigated the relation between alpha and internally vs. externally directed attention using mental imagery vs. sensory-intake paradigms. Results from both experiments showed a clear relationship between alpha and both attentional factors and increased task demands. At various scalp sites alpha amplitudes were greater during internally directed attention and during increased load, results incompatible with alpha reflecting cortical idling and more in keeping with suggestions of active inhibition necessary for internally driven mental operations.},

	Abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models. In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and powerhungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are broken up into runs (or `sessions'), frequently selected to be long to minimize across-run signal variations. For investigations that use multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), however, employing many short runs might improve a classifier's ability to generalize across irrelevant pattern variations and detect condition-related activity patterns. We directly tested this hypothesis by scanning participants with both long and short runs and comparing MVPA performance using data from each set of runs. Every run included presentations of faces, places, man-made objects and fruit in a blocked 1-back design. MVPA performance significantly improved from using a large number of short runs, compared to several long runs, in across-run classifications with identical amounts of data. Superior classification was found across variations in the classifier employed, feature selection procedure and region of interest. Performance improvements also extended to an information brain mapping `searchlight' procedure. These results suggest that investigators looking to maximize the detection of subtle multi-voxel patterns across runs might consider employing short fMRI runs.},

	Abstract = {Traditional (univariate) analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data relies exclusively on the information contained in the time course of individual voxels. Multivariate analyses can take advantage of the information contained in activity patterns across space, from multiple voxels. Such analyses have the potential to greatly expand the amount of information extracted from fMRI data sets. In the present study, multivariate statistical pattern recognition methods, including linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines, were used to classify patterns of fMRI activation evoked by the visual presentation of various categories of objects. Classifiers were trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest during a subset of trials for each subject individually. Classification of subsequently collected fMRI data was attempted according to the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples. Classification was done using only small amounts of data (20 s worth) at a time, so such a technique could, in principle, be used to extract information about a subject's percept on a near real-time basis. Classifiers trained on data acquired during one session were equally accurate in classifying data collected within the same session and across sessions separated by more than a week, in the same subject. Although the highest classification accuracies were obtained using patterns of activity including lower visual areas as input, classification accuracies well above chance were achieved using regions of interest restricted to higher-order object-selective visual areas. In contrast to typical fMRI data analysis, in which hours of data across many subjects are averaged to reveal slight differences in activation, the use of pattern recognition methods allows a subtle 10-way discrimination to be performed on an essentially trial-by-trial basis within individuals, demonstrating that fMRI data contain far more information than is typically appreciated.},

	Abstract = {Individual differences in brain organization exist at many spatial and temporal scales, contributing to the substantial heterogeneity underlying human thought and behavior. Oscillatory neural activity is crucial for these behaviors, but how such rhythms are expressed across the cortex within and across individuals has not been thoroughly characterized. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with representational similarity and multivariate classification techniques, we provide a systematic characterization of brain-wide activity across frequency bands and oscillatory features during rest and task performance. Results indicate that oscillatory profiles exhibit sizable group-level correspondences, indicating the presence of common templates of oscillatory organization. At the same time, we observed well-defined subject-specific network profiles that were discernible above and beyond the structure shared across individuals. These individualized patterns were sufficiently stable over time to allow successful classification of individuals several months later. Finally, our findings indicate that the network structure of rhythmic activity varies considerably across distinct oscillatory frequencies and features, suggesting the existence of multiple, parallel information processing streams embedded in distributed electrophysiological activity. Together, these findings affirm the richness of spatiotemporal EEG signals and emphasize the utility of multivariate network analyses for understanding the role of brain oscillations in physiology and behavior.},

	Abstract = {The direct modulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons by dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) is controversial owing to the thick caliber and low density of DA axons in the STN. The abnormal activity of the STN in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is central to the appearance of symptoms, is therefore thought to result from the loss of DA in the striatum. We carried out three experiments in rats to explore the function of DA in the STN: (i) light and electron microscopic analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-, dopamine b-hydroxylase (DbH)- and DA-immunoreactive structures to determine whether DA axons form synapses; (ii) fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) to determine whether DA axons release DA; and (iii) patch clamp recording to determine whether DA, at a concentration similar to that detected by FCV, can modulate activity and synaptic transmission {$\fracslash$} integration. TH- and DAimmunoreactive axons mostly formed symmetric synapses. Because DbH-immunoreactive axons were rare and formed asymmetric synapses, they comprised the minority of TH-immunoreactive synapses. Voltammetry demonstrated that DA release was sufficient for the activation of receptors and abolished by blockade of voltage-dependent Na+ channels or removal of extracellular Ca2+. The lifetime and concentration of extracellular DA was increased by blockade of the DA transporter. Dopamine application depolarized STN neurons, increased their frequency of activity and reduced the impact of c-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inputs. These findings suggest that SN DA neurons directly modulate the activity of STN neurons and their loss may contribute to the abnormal activity of STN neurons in PD.},

Design Positron emission tomographic study of patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers. Positron emission tomographic data were collected between July 21, 1995, and September 11, 1997, and data analyses were conducted in 1999-2001. Setting The Mental Health Clinical Research Center at the University of Iowa, Iowa City. Participants Sixteen healthy volunteers with a mean age of 29.5 years and 18 patients with schizophrenia and a mean age of 30.0 years. Main Outcome Measure Areas of relative increase or decrease in regional cerebral blood flow, measured using positron emission tomography and the [15O]water method while participants performed an emotion-induction olfactory task to determine response to pleasant (vanillin) and unpleasant (4-methylvaleric acid) odors, compared between patients and healthy volunteers.
Results Patients with schizophrenia subjectively experienced unpleasant odors in a manner similar to healthy volunteers but showed impairment in the experience of pleasant odors. The analysis of the regional cerebral blood flow revealed that patients failed to activate limbic/paralimbic regions (eg, insular cortex, nucleus accumbens, and parahippocampal gyrus) during the experience of unpleasant odors, recruiting a compensatory set of frontal cortical regions instead.

	Abstract = {It is an intriguing concept to use oscillators as fundamental building blocks of electronic computers. The idea is not new, but is currently subject to intense research as a part of the quest for 'beyond Moore' electronic devices. In this paper we give an engineering-minded survey of oscillator-based computing architectures, with the goal of understanding their promise and limitations for next-generation computing. We will mostly discuss non-Boolean, neurally-inspired computing concepts and put the emphasis on hardware and on circuits where the oscillators are realized from emerging, nanoscale building blocks. Despite all the promise that oscillatory computing holds, existing literature gives very few clear-cut arguments about the possible benefits of using oscillators in place of other analog nonlinear circuit elements. In this survey we will argue for finding the rationale of using oscillatory building blocks and call for benchmarking studies that compare oscillatory computing circuits to level-based (analog) implementations.},

Here, we examine the generation of gamma oscillation currents in the hippocampus, using twodimensional, 96-site silicon probes. Two gamma generators were identified, one in the dentate gyrus and another in the CA3-CA1 regions. The coupling strength between the two oscillators varied during both theta and nontheta states. Both pyramidal cells and interneurons were phase-locked to gamma waves. Anatomical connectivity, rather than physical distance, determined the coupling strength of the oscillating neurons. CA3 pyramidal neurons discharged CA3 and CA1 interneurons at latencies indicative of monosynaptic connections. Intrahippocampal gamma oscillation emerges in the CA3 recurrent system, which entrains the CA1 region via its interneurons.},

Aiming at devoting entire deep networks to decision making alone, we propose a new method for learning policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are generated by a novel algorithm based on Vector Quantization and Sparse Coding, trained online along with the network, and capable of growing its dictionary size over time. We also introduce new techniques allowing both the neural network and the evolution strategy to cope with varying dimensions. This enables networks of only 6 to 18 neurons to learn to play a selection of Atari games with performance comparable\textemdash{}and occasionally superior\textemdash{}to state-of-the-art techniques using evolution strategies on deep networks two orders of magnitude larger.},

	Abstract = {Dendritic spines are small, bulbous protrusions along dendrites in neurons and play a critical role in synaptic transmission. Dendritic spines come in a variety of shapes that depend on their developmental state. Additionally, roughly 14{$\sim$}19\% of mature spines have a specialized endoplasmic reticulum called the spine apparatus. How do the shape of a postsynaptic spine and its internal organization affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of short timescale signaling? This question is central for understanding the beginnings of synaptic transmission, learning, and memory formation. In this work, we used mathematical modeling using reaction-diffusion equations in idealized geometries (ellipsoids and spheres) to characterize the effect of spine and spine apparatus geometries on the spatio-temporal dynamics of second messengers. Our analyses and simulations showed that in the short timescale, spine size and shape coupled with the spine apparatus geometries govern the spatiotemporal chemical dynamics of second messengers within the cell. We showed that the curvature of the geometries gives rise to pseudoharmonic functions, which predict the locations of maximum and minimum concentrations. Furthermore, we showed that the lifetime of the chemical gradient can be fine-tuned by localization of fluxes on the spine head and varying the relative curvatures and distances between the spine apparatus and the spine head. Thus, we identified some of the key geometric determinants of how spine head and spine apparatus may regulate the short timescale chemical dynamics of small molecules.},

	Abstract = {Each region in the cortex receives input through millions of axons from sensory organs and from other cortical regions. It remains a mystery how cortical neurons learn to form specific connections from this large number of unlabeled inputs in order to support further computations. Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) provides a theoretical framework for understanding the computational principles in the neocortex. In this paper we describe an important component of HTM, the HTM spatial pooler that models how neurons learn feedforward connections. The spatial pooler converts arbitrary binary input patterns into sparse distributed representations (SDRs) using competitive Hebbian learning rules and homeostasis excitability control mechanisms. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate the key computational properties of HTM spatial pooler, including preserving semantic similarity among inputs, fast adaptation to changing statistics of the inputs, improved noise robustness over learning, efficient use of all cells and flexibility in the event of cell death or loss of input afferents. To quantify these properties, we developed a set of metrics that can be directly measured from the spatial pooler outputs. These metrics can be used as complementary performance indicators for any sparse coding algorithm. We discuss the relationship with neuroscience and previous studies of sparse coding and competitive learning. The HTM spatial pooler represents a neurally inspired algorithm for learning SDRs from noisy data streams online.},

	Abstract = {As robots leave the controlled environments of factories to autonomously function in more complex, natural environments, they will have to respond to the inevitable fact that they will become damaged. However, while animals can quickly adapt to a wide variety of injuries, current robots cannot "think outside the box" to find a compensatory behavior when damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. Here we introduce an intelligent trial and error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes, without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before deployment, a robot exploits a novel algorithm to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviors: This map represents the robot's intuitions about what behaviors it can perform and their value. If the robot is damaged, it uses these intuitions to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a compensatory behavior that works in spite of the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new technique will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and suggests principles that animals may use to adapt to injury.},

It is unclear how the brain may do this, however, as it can only rely on neural responses and has no independent access to external stimuli in order to ``decode'' what those responses mean. We investigate what can be learned about a space of stimuli using only the action potentials (spikes) of cells with stereotyped\textemdash{}but unknown\textemdash{}receptive fields. Using hippocampal place cells as a model system, we show that one can (1) extract global features of the environment and (2) construct an accurate representation of space, up to an overall scale factor, that can be used to track the animal's position. Unlike previous approaches to reconstructing position from place cell activity, this information is derived without knowing place fields or any other functions relating neural responses to position. We find that simply knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space; this may enable the brain to construct its own internal representations.},

An important problem confronted by the brain is to infer properties of a represented stimulus space without knowledge of the receptive fields, using only the intrinsic structure of the neural code. How does the brain do this? To address this question, it is important to determine what stimulus space features can\textemdash{}in principle\textemdash{}be extracted from neural codes. This motivates us to define the neural ring and a related neural ideal, algebraic objects that encode the full combinatorial data of a neural code. Our main finding is that these objects can be expressed in a ``canonical form'' that directly translates to a minimal description of the receptive field structure intrinsic to the code. We also find connections to Stanley\textendash{}Reisner rings, and use ideas similar to those in the theory of monomial ideals to obtain an algorithm for computing the primary decomposition of pseudo-monomial ideals. This allows us to algorithmically extract the canonical form associated to any neural code, providing the groundwork for inferring stimulus space features from neural activity alone.},

We now relate maps between neural codes to notions of homomorphism between the corresponding neural rings. Using three natural operations on neural codes (permutation, inclusion, deletion) as motivation, we search for a restricted class of homomorphisms which correspond to these natural operations. We choose the framework of linear-monomial module homomorphisms, and find that the class of associated code maps neatly captures these three operations, and necessarily includes two others - repetition and adding trivial neurons - which are also meaningful in a neural coding context.},

	Abstract = {Threshold-linear networks are a common class of firing rate models that describe recurrent interactions among neurons. Unlike their linear counterparts, these networks generically possess multiple stable fixed points (steady states), making them viable candidates for memory encoding and retrieval. In this work, we characterize stable fixed points of general threshold-linear networks with constant external drive, and discover constraints on the co-existence of fixed points involving different subsets of active neurons. In the case of symmetric networks, we prove the following antichain property: if a set of neurons {$\tau$} is the support of a stable fixed point, then no proper subset or superset of {$\tau$} can support a stable fixed point. Symmetric threshold-linear networks thus appear to be well suited for pattern completion, since the dynamics are guaranteed not to get ``stuck'' in a subset or superset of a stored pattern. We also show that for any graph G, we can construct a network whose stable fixed points correspond precisely to the maximal cliques of G. As an application, we design network decoders for place field codes, and demonstrate their efficacy for error correction and pattern completion. The proofs of our main results build on the theory of permitted sets in threshold-linear networks, including recently-developed connections to classical distance geometry.},

Here we explored whether selective averaging techniques similar to those applied in event-related potential (ERP) experiments could be used to demonstrate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to rapidly intermixed trials. In the first two experiments, we observed that for 1-sec trials of full-field visual checkerboard stimulation, the fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal summated in a roughly linear fashion across successive trials even at very short (2 sec and 5 sec) intertrial intervals, although subtle departures from linearity were observed. In experiments 3 and 4, we observed that it is possible to obtain robust activation maps for rapidly presented randomly mixed trial types (left- and right-hemifield visual checkerboard stimulation) spaced as little as 2 sec apart. Taken collectively, these results suggest that selective averaging may enable fMRI experimental designs identical to those used in typical behavioral and ERP studies. The ability to analyze closely spaced single-trial, or event-related, signals provides for a class of experiments which cannot be conducted using blocked designs. Trial types can be randomly intermixed, and selective averaging based upon trial type and/or subject performance is possible. Hum. Brain Mapping 5:329\textendash{}340, 1997.},

	Abstract = {We often need to learn how to move based on a single performance measure that reflects the overall success of our movements. However, movements have many properties, such as their trajectories, speeds and timing of end-points, thus the brain needs to decide which properties of movements should be improved; it needs to solve the credit assignment problem. Currently, little is known about how humans solve credit assignment problems in the context of reinforcement learning. Here we tested how human participants solve such problems during a trajectory-learning task. Without an explicitly-defined target movement, participants made hand reaches and received monetary rewards as feedback on a trialby-trial basis. The curvature and direction of the attempted reach trajectories determined the monetary rewards received in a manner that can be manipulated experimentally. Based on the history of action-reward pairs, participants quickly solved the credit assignment problem and learned the implicit payoff function. A Bayesian credit-assignment model with built-in forgetting accurately predicts their trial-by-trial learning.},

	Abstract = {Stochastic resonance (SR) is the enhanced representation of a weak input signal by the addition of an optimal level of broadband noise to a nonlinear (threshold) system. Since its discovery in the 1980s the domain of input signals shown to be applicable to SR has greatly expanded, from strictly periodic inputs to now nearly any aperiodic forcing function. The perturbations (noise) used to generate SR have also expanded, from white noise to now colored noise or vibrational forcing. This study demonstrates that a new class of perturbations can achieve SR, namely, series of stochastically generated biphasic pulse trains. Using these pulse trains as `noise' we show that a Hodgkin Huxley model neuron exhibits SR behavior when detecting weak input signals. This result is of particular interest to neuroscience because nearly all artificial neural stimulation is implemented with square current or voltage pulses rather than broadband noise, and this new method may facilitate the translation of the performance gains achievable through SR to neural prosthetics.},

	Abstract = {Deep learning models frequently trade handcrafted features for deep features learned with much less human intervention using gradient descent. While this paradigm has been enormously successful, deep networks are often difficult to train and performance can depend crucially on the initial choice of parameters. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called MetaInit as a step towards automating the search for good initializations using meta-learning. Our approach is based on a hypothesis that good initializations make gradient descent easier by starting in regions that look locally linear with minimal second order effects. We formalize this notion via a quantity that we call the gradient quotient, which can be computed with any architecture or dataset. MetaInit minimizes this quantity efficiently by using gradient descent to tune the norms of the initial weight matrices. We conduct experiments on plain and residual networks and show that the algorithm can automatically recover from a class of bad initializations. MetaInit allows us to train networks and achieve performance competitive with the state-of-the-art without batch normalization or residual connections. In particular, we find that this approach outperforms normalization for networks without skip connections on CIFAR-10 and can scale to Resnet-50 models on Imagenet.},

	Abstract = {Although MEG/EEG signals are highly variable, systematic changes in distinct frequency bands are commonly encountered. These frequency-specific changes represent robust neural correlates of cognitive or perceptual processes (for example, alpha rhythms emerge on closing the eyes). However, their functional significance remains a matter of debate. Some of the mechanisms that generate these signals are known at the cellular level and rest on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within and between populations of neurons. The kinetics of the ensuing population dynamics determine the frequency of oscillations. In this work we extended the classical nonlinear lumped-parameter model of alpha rhythms, initially developed by Lopes da Silva and colleagues [Kybernetik 15 (1974) 27], to generate more complex dynamics. We show that the whole spectrum of MEG/EEG signals can be reproduced within the oscillatory regime of this model by simply changing the population kinetics. We used the model to examine the influence of coupling strength and propagation delay on the rhythms generated by coupled cortical areas. The main findings were that (1) coupling induces phase-locked activity, with a phase shift of 0 or ␲ when the coupling is bidirectional, and (2) both coupling and propagation delay are critical determinants of the MEG/EEG spectrum. In forthcoming articles, we will use this model to (1) estimate how neuronal interactions are expressed in MEG/EEG oscillations and establish the construct validity of various indices of nonlinear coupling, and (2) generate event-related transients to derive physiologically informed basis functions for statistical modelling of average evoked responses.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel approach based on modern deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) for understanding how the morpho-electrical complexity of neurons shapes their input/output (I/O) properties at the millisecond resolution in response to massive synaptic input. The I/O of integrate and fire point neuron is accurately captured by a DNN with a single unit and one hidden layer. A fully connected DNN with one hidden layer faithfully replicated the I/O relationship of a detailed model of Layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell (L5PC) receiving AMPA and GABAA synapses. However, when adding voltage-gated NMDA-conductances, a temporally-convolutional DNN with seven layers was required. Analysis of the DNN filters provides new insights into dendritic processing shaping the I/O properties of neurons. This work proposes a systematic approach for characterizing the functional ``depth'' of a biological neurons, suggesting that cortical pyramidal neurons and the networks they form are computationally much more powerful than previously assumed.},

	Abstract = {Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has led to major changes in how fMRI data are analyzed and interpreted. Many studies now report both MVPA results and results from standard univariate voxel-wise analysis, often with the goal of drawing different conclusions from each. Because MVPA results can be sensitive to latent multidimensional representations and processes whereas univariate voxel-wise analysis cannot, one conclusion that is often drawn when MVPA and univariate results differ is that the activation patterns underlying MVPA results contain a multidimensional code. In the current study, we conducted simulations to formally test this assumption. Our findings reveal that MVPA tests are sensitive to the magnitude of voxel-level variability in the effect of a condition within subjects, even when the same linear relationship is coded in all voxels. We also find that MVPA is insensitive to subject-level variability in mean activation across an ROI, which is the primary variance component of interest in many standard univariate tests. Together, these results illustrate that differences between MVPA and univariate tests do not afford conclusions about the nature or dimensionality of the neural code. Instead, targeted tests of the informational content and/or dimensionality of activation patterns are critical for drawing strong conclusions about the representational codes that are indicated by significant MVPA results.},

	Abstract = {Although theorists have interpreted classical conditioning as a laboratory model of Bayesian belief updating, a recent reanalysis showed that the key features that theoretical models capture about learning are artifacts of averaging over subjects. Rather than learning smoothly to asymptote (reflecting, according to Bayesian models, the gradual tradeoff from prior to posterior as data accumulate), subjects learn suddenly, and their predictions fluctuate perpetually. We suggest that abrupt and unstable learning can be modeled by assuming subjects are conducting inference using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with a small number of samples \textemdash{} one, in our simulations. Ensemble behavior resembles exact Bayesian models since, as in particle filters, it averages over many samples. Further, the model is capable of exhibiting sophisticated behaviors like retrospective revaluation at the ensemble level, even given minimally sophisticated individuals that do not track uncertainty in their beliefs over trials.},

	Abstract = {A scientifically adequate theory of semiotic processes must ultimately be founded on a theory of information that can unify the physical, biological, cognitive, and computational uses of the concept. Unfortunately, no such unification exists, and more importantly, the causal status of informational content remains ambiguous as a result. Lacking this grounding, semiotic theories have tended to be predominantly phenomenological taxonomies rather than dynamical explanations of the representational processes of natural systems. This paper argues that the problem of information that prevents the development of a scientific semiotic theory is the necessity of analyzing it as a negative relationship: defined with respect to absence. This is cryptically implicit in concepts of design and function in biology, acknowledged in psychological and philosophical accounts of intentionality and content, and is explicitly formulated in the mathematical theory of communication (aka ``information theory''). Beginning from the base established by Claude Shannon, which otherwise ignores issues of content, reference, and evaluation, this two part essay explores its relationship to two other higher-order theories that are also explicitly based on an analysis of absence: Boltzmann's theory of thermodynamic entropy (in Part 1) and Darwin's theory of natural selection (in Part 2). This comparison demonstrates that these theories are both formally homologous and hierarchically interdependent. Their synthesis into a general theory of entropy and information provides the necessary grounding for theories of function and semiosis.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the first actor-critic algorithm for off-policy reinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its per-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights. Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting and does not take advantage of the recent advances in offpolicy gradient temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another (behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a large action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the generality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental, linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces, prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms1, and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems.},

While these findings suggest parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction in DISC1-related pathophysiology, to date, cortical inhibitory circuit function has not been investigated in depth in DISC1 deficiency mouse models. Here we assessed the function of a feedforward circuit between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice harboring a deletion in one allele of the Disc1 gene. We found that the inhibitory drive onto layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC was significantly reduced in the Disc1 deficient mice. This reduced inhibition was accompanied by decreased GABA release from local parvalbumin, but not somatostatin, inhibitory interneurons, and by impaired feedforward inhibition in the MD-mPFC circuit. Our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which deficiency in DISC1 causes neural circuit dysfunction frequently implicated in psychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {Recurrent neural networks are powerful tools for understanding and modeling computation and representation by populations of neurons. Continuous-variable or ``rate'' model networks have been analyzed and applied extensively for these purposes. However, neurons fire action potentials, and the discrete nature of spiking is an important feature of neural circuit dynamics. Despite significant advances, training recurrently connected spiking neural networks remains a challenge. We present a procedure for training recurrently connected spiking networks to generate dynamical patterns autonomously, to produce complex temporal outputs based on integrating network input, and to model physiological data. Our procedure makes use of a continuous-variable network to identify targets for training the inputs to the spiking model neurons. Surprisingly, we are able to construct spiking networks that duplicate tasks performed by continuous-variable networks with only a relatively minor expansion in the number of neurons. Our approach provides a novel view of the significance and appropriate use of ``firing rate'' models, and it is a useful approach for building model spiking networks that can be used to address important questions about representation and computation in neural systems.},

The method introduces a second network during training to provide suitable ``target'' dynamics useful for performing the task. Because it exploits the full recurrent connectivity, the method produces networks that perform tasks with fewer neurons and greater noise robustness than traditional least-squares (FORCE) approaches. In addition, we show how introducing additional input signals into the target-generating network, which act as task hints, greatly extends the range of tasks that can be learned and provides control over the complexity and nature of the dynamics of the trained, task-performing network.},

	Abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data, which can be used to detect distributed patterns of activity that encode an experimental factor of interest. In this setting, it has become common practice to study the correlations between patterns to make inferences about the way a brain region represents stimuli or tasks (known as representational similarity analysis). Although it would be of great interest to compare these correlations from different regions, direct comparisons are currently not possible. This is because sample correlations are strongly influenced by voxel-selection, fMRI noise, and nonspecific activation patterns, all of which can differ widely between regions. Here, we present a multivariate modeling framework in which the measured patterns are decomposed into their constituent parts. The model is based on a standard linear mixed model, in which pattern components are considered to be randomly distributed over voxels. The model allows one to estimate the true correlations of the underlying neuronal pattern components, thereby enabling comparisons between different regions or individuals. The pattern estimates also allow us to make inferences about the spatial structure of different response components. Thus, the new model provides a theoretical and analytical framework to study the structure of distributed neural representations.},

	Abstract = {Deep neural networks such as Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) represent the state-of-the-art for many machine learning and computer vision classification problems. To overcome the large computational cost of deep networks, spiking deep networks have recently been proposed, given the specialized hardware now available for spiking neural networks (SNNs). However, this has come at the cost of performance losses due to the conversion from analog neural networks (ANNs) without a notion of time, to sparsely firing, event-driven SNNs. Here we analyze the effects of converting deep ANNs into SNNs with respect to the choice of parameters for spiking neurons such as firing rates and thresholds. We present a set of optimization techniques to minimize performance loss in the conversion process for ConvNets and fully connected deep networks. These techniques yield networks that outperform all previous SNNs on the MNIST database to date, and many networks here are close to maximum performance after only 20 ms of simulated time. The techniques include using rectified linear units (ReLUs) with zero bias during training, and using a new weight normalization method to help regulate firing rates. Our method for converting an ANN into an SNN enables lowlatency classification with high accuracies already after the first output spike, and compared with previous SNN approaches it yields improved performance without increased training time. The presented analysis and optimization techniques boost the value of spiking deep networks as an attractive framework for neuromorphic computing platforms aimed at fast and efficient pattern recognition.},

	Abstract = {A body of research demonstrates convincingly a role for synchronization of auditory cortex to rhythmic structure in sounds including speech and music. Some studies hypothesize that an oscillator in auditory cortex could underlie important temporal processes such as segmentation and prediction. An important critique of these findings raises the plausible concern that what is measured is perhaps not an oscillator but is instead a sequence of evoked responses. The two distinct mechanisms could look very similar in the case of rhythmic input, but an oscillator might better provide the computational roles mentioned above (i.e., segmentation and prediction). We advance an approach to adjudicate between the two models: analyzing the phase lag between stimulus and neural signal across different stimulation rates. We ran numerical simulations of evoked and oscillatory computational models, showing that in the evoked case,phase lag is heavily rate-dependent, while the oscillatory model displays marked phase concentration across stimulation rates. Next, we compared these model predictions with magnetoencephalography data recorded while participants listened to music of varying note rates. Our results show that the phase concentration of the experimental data is more in line with the oscillatory model than with the evoked model. This finding supports an auditory cortical signal that (
              i
              ) contains components of both bottom-up evoked responses and internal oscillatory synchronization whose strengths are weighted by their appropriateness for particular stimulus types and (
              ii
              ) cannot be explained by evoked responses alone.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental task of a sensory system is to infer information about the environment. It has long been suggested that an important goal of the first stage of this process is to encode the raw sensory signal efficiently by reducing its redundancy in the neural representation. Some redundancy, however, would be expected because it can provide robustness to noise inherent in the system. Encoding the raw sensory signal itself is also problematic, because it contains distortion and noise. The optimal solution would be constrained further by limited biological resources. Here, we analyze a simple theoretical model that incorporates these key aspects of sensory coding, and apply it to conditions in the retina. The model specifies the optimal way to incorporate redundancy in a population of noisy neurons, while also optimally compensating for sensory distortion and noise. Importantly, it allows an arbitrary input-to-output cell ratio between sensory units (photoreceptors) and encoding units (retinal ganglion cells), providing predictions of retinal codes at different eccentricities. Compared to earlier models based on redundancy reduction, the proposed model conveys more information about the original signal. Interestingly, redundancy reduction can be near-optimal when the number of encoding units is limited, such as in the peripheral retina. We show that there exist multiple, equally-optimal solutions whose receptive field structure and organization vary significantly. Among these, the one which maximizes the spatial locality of the computation, but not the sparsity of either synaptic weights or neural responses, is consistent with known basic properties of retinal receptive fields. The model further predicts that receptive field structure changes less with light adaptation at higher input-to-output cell ratios, such as in the periphery.},

	Abstract = {The rich dynamical nature of neurons poses major conceptual and technical challenges for unraveling their nonlinear membrane properties. Traditionally, various current waveforms have been injected at the soma to probe neuron dynamics, but the rationale for selecting specific stimuli has never been rigorously justified. The present experimental and theoretical study proposes a novel framework, inspired by learning theory, for objectively selecting the stimuli that best unravel the neuron's dynamics. The efficacy of stimuli is assessed in terms of their ability to constrain the parameter space of biophysically detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the neuron's dynamics as attested by their ability to generalize well to the neuron's response to novel experimental stimuli. We used this framework to evaluate a variety of stimuli in different types of cortical neurons, ages and animals. Despite their simplicity, a set of stimuli consisting of step and ramp current pulses outperforms synaptic-like noisy stimuli in revealing the dynamics of these neurons. The general framework that we propose paves a new way for defining, evaluating and standardizing effective electrical probing of neurons and will thus lay the foundation for a much deeper understanding of the electrical nature of these highly sophisticated and non-linear devices and of the neuronal networks that they compose.},

	Abstract = {Background: Our brains are capable of remarkably stable stimulus representations despite time-varying neural activity. For instance, during delay periods in working memory tasks, while stimuli are represented in working memory, neurons in the prefrontal cortex, thought to support the memory representation, exhibit time-varying neuronal activity. Since neuronal activity encodes the stimulus, its time-varying dynamics appears to be paradoxical and incompatible with stable network stimulus representations. Indeed, this finding raises a fundamental question: can stable representations only be encoded with stable neural activity, or, its corollary, is every change in activity a sign of change in stimulus representation?
Results: Here we explain how different time-varying representations offered by individual neurons can be woven together to form a coherent, time-invariant, representation. Motivated by two ubiquitous features of the neocortex\textemdash{}redundancy of neural representation and sparse intracortical connections\textemdash{}we derive a network architecture that resolves the apparent contradiction between representation stability and changing neural activity. Unexpectedly, this network architecture exhibits many structural properties that have been measured in cortical sensory areas. In particular, we can account for few-neuron motifs, synapse weight distribution, and the relations between neuronal functional properties and connection probability.
Conclusions: We show that the intuition regarding network stimulus representation, typically derived from considering single neurons, may be misleading and that time-varying activity of distributed representation in cortical circuits does not necessarily imply that the network explicitly encodes time-varying properties.},

@article{Dummer2014,
	Abstract = {A major source of random variability in cortical networks is the quasi-random arrival of presynaptic action potentials from many other cells. In network studies as well as in the study of the response properties of single cells embedded in a network, synaptic background input is often approximated by Poissonian spike trains. However, the output statistics of the cells is in most cases far from being Poisson. This is inconsistent with the assumption of similar spike-train statistics for pre- and postsynaptic cells in a recurrent network. Here we tackle this problem for the popular class of integrate-and-fire neurons and study a self-consistent statistics of input and output spectra of neural spike trains. Instead of actually using a large network, we use an iterative scheme, in which we simulate a single neuron over several generations. In each of these generations, the neuron is stimulated with surrogate stochastic input that has a similar statistics as the output of the previous generation. For the surrogate input, we employ two distinct approximations: (i) a superposition of renewal spike trains with the same interspike interval density as observed in the previous generation and (ii) a Gaussian current with a power spectrum proportional to that observed in the previous generation. For input parameters that correspond to balanced input in the network, both the renewal and the Gaussian iteration procedure converge quickly and yield comparable results for the self-consistent spike-train power spectrum. We compare our results to large-scale simulations of a random sparsely connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (Brunel, 2000) and show that in the asynchronous regime close to a state of balanced synaptic input from the network, our iterative schemes provide an excellent approximations to the autocorrelation of spike trains in the recurrent network.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel model of tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) based on extensive literature review as well as novel results stemming from functional stereotactic neurosurgery for the alleviation of tremor in PD. Specifically, evidence that suggests the basal ganglia induces PD tremor via excessive inhibitory output to the thalamus and altered firing patterns which in turn generate rhythmic bursting activity of thalamic cells is presented. Then, evidence that the thalamus generates PD tremor by facilitating the generation and consolidation of rhythmic bursting activity of neurons within its nuclei is also offered. Finally, evidence that the cerebellum may modulate characteristics of PD tremor by treating it as if it was a voluntary motor behavior is presented. Accordingly, the current paper proposes that PD tremor is induced by abnormal basal ganglia activity; it is generated by the thalamus, and modulated or reinforced by the cerebellum.},

@article{Ebert2014,
	Abstract = {Synchronization of populations of neurons is a hallmark of several brain diseases. Coordinated reset (CR) stimulation is a model-based stimulation technique which specifically counteracts abnormal synchrony by desynchronization. Electrical CR stimulation, e.g., for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), is administered via depth electrodes. In order to get a deeper understanding of this technique, we extended the top-down approach of previous studies and constructed a large-scale computational model of the respective brain areas. Furthermore, we took into account the spatial anatomical properties of the simulated brain structures and incorporated a detailed numerical representation of 2 {$\cdot$} 104 simulated neurons. We simulated the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus externus (GPe). Connections within the STN were governed by spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). In this way, we modeled the physiological and pathological activity of the considered brain structures. In particular, we investigated how plasticity could be exploited and how the model could be shifted from strongly synchronized (pathological) activity to strongly desynchronized (healthy) activity of the neuronal populations via CR stimulation of the STN neurons. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of specific stimulation parameters especially the electrode position on the stimulation outcome. Our model provides a step forward toward a biophysically realistic model of the brain areas relevant to the emergence of pathological neuronal activity in PD. Furthermore, our model constitutes a test bench for the optimization of both stimulation parameters and novel electrode geometries for efficient CR stimulation.},

@article{Ecoffet2019,
	Abstract = {A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration, especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall. On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic motivation, which is the dominant method to encourage exploration and improve performance on hardexploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember states that have previously been visited, (2) first return to a promising state (without exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments through exploiting any available means (including by introducing determinism), then robustify (create a policy that can reliably perform the solution) via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles generates dramatic performance improvements on hardexploration problems. On Montezuma's Revenge, without being provided any domain knowledge, Go-Explore scores over 43,000 points, almost 4 times the previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also easily harness human-provided domain knowledge, and when augmented with it Go-Explore scores a mean of over 650,000 points on Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of 18 million surpasses the human world record by an order of magnitude, thus meeting even the strictest definition of ``superhuman'' performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first algorithm to score above zero. Its mean performance of almost 60,000 points also exceeds expert human performance. Because GoExplore can produce many high-performing demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms previous imitation learning work in which the solution was provided in the form of a human demonstration. Go-Explore opens up many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable hard-exploration problems in a variety of domains, especially the many that often harness a simulator during training (e.g. robotics).},

	Abstract = {This study examines whether 4\textendash{}8-Hz theta oscillations can be seen in the human hippocampus, and whether these oscillations increase during virtual movement and searching, as they do in rodents. Recordings from both hippocampal and neocortical depth electrodes were analyzed while six epileptic patients played a virtual taxi-driver game. During the game, the patients alternated between searching for passengers, whose locations were random, and delivering them to stores, whose locations remained constant. In both hippocampus and neocortex, theta increased during virtual movement in all phases of the game. Hippocampal and neocortical theta activity were also significantly correlated with each other, but this correlation did not differ between neocortex and hippocampus and within disparate neocortical electrodes. Our findings demonstrate the existence of movement-related theta oscillations in human hippocampus, and suggest that both cortical and hippocampal oscillations play a role in attention and sensorimotor integration.

	Abstract = {In awake animals, the cerebral cortex displays an ``activated'' state, with distinct characteristics compared to other states like slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. These characteristics include a sustained depolarized membrane potential (Vm) and irregular firing activity. In the present paper, we evaluate our understanding of cortical activated states from a computational neuroscience point of view. We start by reviewing the electrophysiological characteristics of activated cortical states based on recordings and analysis performed in awake cat association cortex. These analyses show that cortical activity is characterized by an apparent Poisson-distributed stochastic dynamics, both at the single-cell and population levels, and that single cells display a high-conductance state dominated by inhibition. We next overview computational models of the ``awake'' cortex, and perform the same analyses as in the experiments. Many properties identified experimentally are indeed reproduced by models, such as depolarized Vm, irregular firing with apparent Poisson statistics, and the determinant role of inhibitory fluctuations on spiking. However, other features are not well reproduced, such as firing statistics and the conductance state of the membrane, suggesting that the network state displayed by models is not entirely correct. We also show how networks can approach a correct conductance state, suggesting ways by which future models will generate activity fully consistent with experimental data.},

Rate models operating in the chaotic regime show a rich dynamics at the scale of hundreds of milliseconds and provide remarkable learning capabilities. However, neurons in the brain communicate via spikes and it is a major challenge in computational neuroscience to obtain similar slow rate dynamics in networks of spiking neuron models. This question was addressed in a recent paper by Ostojic. The central claim of that paper is the existence of two states of asynchronous activity separated by a phase transition in spiking networks with fast synapses. We found that the analysis presented in the paper is factually incorrect and conceptually misleading. We provide compelling evidence that there is no such phase transition.},

We find that shorter-lasting relationships have an immediate negative impact on both behaviors in the relationships that immediately follow, while longer-lasting relationships have the opposite effect. The effect of stochastic end-points declines for trustworthiness but not for trust as subjects gain experience, indicating that trust is able to rebound when longer-lasting relationships follow shorter-lasting ones.},

However, exact transition probabilities are difficult for experts to specify. One option left to an agent is a long and potentially costly exploration of the environment. In this paper, we propose another alternative: given initial (possibly inaccurate) specification of the MDP, the agent determines the sensitivity of the optimal policy to changes in transitions and rewards. It then focuses its exploration on the regions of space to which the optimal policy is most sensitive. We show that the proposed exploration strategy performs well on several control and planning problems.},

	Abstract = {Working memory (WM) enables the storage and manipulation of information in an active state. WM storage has long been associated with sustained increases in activation across a network of frontal and parietal cortical regions. However, recent evidence suggests that these regions primarily encode information related to general task goals rather than featureselective representations of specific memoranda. These goal-related representations are thought to provide top-down feedback that coordinates the representation of fine-grained details in early sensory areas. Here, we test this model using fMRI-based reconstructions of remembered visual details from region-level activation patterns. We could reconstruct high-fidelity representations of a remembered orientation based on activation patterns in occipital visual cortex and in several sub-regions of frontal and parietal cortex, independent of sustained increases in mean activation. These results challenge models of WM that postulate disjoint frontoparietal ``top-down control'' and posterior sensory ``feature storage'' networks.},

	Abstract = {The ability to correctly interpret emotional signals from others is crucial for successful social interaction. Previous neuroimaging studies showed that voice-sensitive auditory areas [1\textendash{}3] activate to a broad spectrum of vocally expressed emotions more than to neutral speech melody (prosody). However, this enhanced response occurs irrespective of the specific emotion category, making it impossible to distinguish different vocal emotions with conventional analyses [4\textendash{}8]. Here, we presented pseudowords spoken in five prosodic categories (anger, sadness, neutral, relief, joy) during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), then employed multivariate pattern analysis [9, 10] to discriminate between these categories on the basis of the spatial response pattern within the auditory cortex. Our results demonstrate successful decoding of vocal emotions from fMRI responses in bilateral voicesensitive areas, which could not be obtained by using averaged response amplitudes only. Pairwise comparisons showed that each category could be classified against all other alternatives, indicating for each emotion a specific spatial signature that generalized across speakers. These results demonstrate for the first time that emotional information is represented by distinct spatial patterns that can be decoded from brain activity in modality-specific cortical areas.},

This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the confidence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability.

The results are also compared with a square root implementation of the EnKF analysis scheme where the analyzed ensemble is computed without the perturbation of measurements. It is shown that the measurement perturbations introduce sampling errors which can be reduced using improved sampling schemes in the standard EnKF or fully eliminated when the square root analysis algorithm is used. Further, a new computationally efficient square root algorithm is proposed which allows for the use of a low-rank representation of the measurement error covariance matrix. It is shown that this algorithm in fact solves the full problem at a low cost without introducing any new approximations.},

Here we combine optical recording of membrane voltage with simultaneous optogenetic manipulation to probe E and I individually in barrel cortex Layer 1 (L1) neurons in awake mice. Our studies show that L1 neurons integrate thalamocortical excitation and lateral inhibition to produce precisely timed responses to whisker stimuli. Top-down neuromodulatory inputs drive additional excitation in L1. Together, these results suggest a model for computation in L1 consistent with its hypothesized role in attentional gating of the underlying cortex.

The use of quasitrapezoidal-shaped pulses and a tripolar cuff electrode made selective activation of small motor axons possible, thus recruiting slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant muscle units before fast-twitch, fatigable units in a heterogeneous muscle. Isometric contraction force from the medial gastrocnemius muscle was measured in five cats. The physiological recruitment order was evidenced by larger twitch widths at lower force levels and smaller twitch widths at higher force levels in the muscles tested. In addition, force modulation process was more gradual and fused contractions were obtained at lower stimulation frequencies when the new stimulation method was employed. Furthermore, muscles activated by the new method were more fatigue-resistant under repetitive activation at low force levels. This stimulation method is simpler to implement and has fewer adverse effects on the neuromuscular system than previous blocking methods. Therefore, it may have applications in future functional neuromuscular stimulation systems.},

Here, we describe a set of necessary constraints in the form of a system of non-linear partial differential equations that must be satisfied. Moreover, we prove that these conditions are sufficient in both contexts of analytic and bit-value functions. In the latter case, we explicitly enumerate discrete functions and observe that there are relatively few. Our point of view allows us to compare different neural network architectures in regard to their function spaces. Our work connects the structure of computation graphs with the functions they can implement and has potential applications to neuroscience and computer science.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we study cluster synchronization in a network of Kuramoto oscillators, where groups of oscillators evolve cohesively and at different frequencies from the neighboring oscillators. Synchronization is critical in a variety of systems, where it enables complex functionalities and behaviors. Synchronization over networks depends on the oscillators' dynamics, the interaction topology, and coupling strengths, and the relationship between these different factors can be quite intricate. In this work we formally show that three network properties enable the emergence of cluster synchronization. Specifically, weak inter-cluster connections, strong intra-cluster connections, and sufficiently diverse natural frequencies among oscillators belonging to different groups. Our approach relies on system-theoretic tools, and is validated with numerical studies.},

	Abstract = {How do individuals achieve good outcomes" in one shot strategic situations? One much explored possibility is that they engage in some kind of preplay communication|cheap talk|in which they endeavor to convince one another of the actions they intend to play. However, there may be no incentive for such communication to be truthful, or even informative. Another, less explored, possibility is that individuals take account of their knowledge of the past behavior of others when deciding which actions to play. While these two possibilities have been considered separately, there has been little research comparing the importance of these two devices as aids in achieving good outcomes. We design and run an experiment with human subjects that allows for such a comparison. The e ects of cheap talk and observation of past actions are compared with each other, and with the standard control case where neither cheap talk nor observation is allowed. We consider three di erent 2  2 games and explain why cheap talk or observation is likely to be the more e ective device for achieving good outcomes in each game. The experimental evidence suggests that both devices|cheap talk and observation| make cooperation and successful coordination more likely and increase payo s relative to the control. The relative success of cheap talk versus observation in achieving such good outcomes depends on the game played, in accordance with our predictions. We also nd that the signals players send are informative in the sense that they are cor related with their eventual actions, and that receivers of signals take this fact into account by conditioning their actions on the signal they receive. The results of this experiment can be used to extend game theoretic models of how individuals make use of the di erent types of information available in strategic environments. As a rst step in this direction, we construct a learning model in which individuals can condition their behavior on cheap talk or observed past actions, and we show that this model provides a good quantitative as well as qualitative t to the experimental data.},

	Abstract = {A proposed continuum of learning strategies, from model-free to model-based, is thought to progress systematically in complexity and therefore flexibility. Here we distinguish different forms of complexity to show that, contrary to this idea, strategies at both ends of this continuum can be equally flexible. Using a canonical learning task, we first simulated behavior to show that computational complexity, a measure of implementation demands, is higher for a standard modelbased versus model-free algorithm, but information complexity, a measure of flexibility, is not. We then analyzed human behavior to show that information complexity, which unlike computational complexity can be estimated from behavior, tended to increase for strategies that were increasingly either model-free or model-based, resulting in similar accuracy, suboptimal use of information, and increased response times. Thus, model-free and model-based strategies can have similar overall flexibility and instead are better distinguished by the specific task features from which they learn.},

	Abstract = {When learning the value of actions in volatile environments, humans often make seemingly irrational decisions which fail to maximize expected value. We reasoned that these 'non-greedy' decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here, using reinforcement learning (RL) models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stems from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by BOLD responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and by phasic pupillary dilation - suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Together, these findings indicate that most of behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.},

	Abstract = {Foraging animals have distinct exploration and exploitation behaviors that are organized into discrete behavioral states. Here, we characterize a neuromodulatory circuit that generates long-lasting roaming and dwelling states in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), each initiate and extend one behavioral state. Serotonin promotes dwelling states through the MOD-1 serotonin-gated chloride channel. The spontaneous activity of serotonergic neurons correlates with dwelling behavior, and optogenetic modulation of the critical MOD-1-expressing targets induces prolonged dwelling states. PDF promotes roaming states through a Gas-coupled PDF receptor; optogenetic activation of cAMP production in PDF receptor-expressing cells induces prolonged roaming states. The neurons that produce and respond to each neuromodulator form a distributed circuit orthogonal to the classical wiring diagram, with several essential neurons that express each molecule. The slow temporal dynamics of this neuromodulatory circuit supplement fast motor circuits to organize long-lasting behavioral states.},

Here, we demonstrate within a functionally defined area that neocortical thickness governs the anatomical, electrophysiological, and computational properties of the principal output neurons of the neocortex. We find that neocortical thickness and the size of layer 5B pyramidal neurons changes as a gradient across the rostro-caudal axis of the rat primary visual cortex. Simultaneous somato-dendritic whole-cell recordings and compartmental modeling revealed that the electrical architecture of principal neurons was not preserved; rather, primary visual cortex site-dependent differences in intracellular resistivity accentuated a gradient of the electrical behavior of layer 5B pyramidal neurons to influence the emergence of active dendritic computations. Our findings therefore reveal an exquisite relationship between neocortical structure and neuronal computation.},

One aspect of this problem is to determine how an action potential, or spike, can be elicited with the least energy cost, e.g., a minimal amount of applied current. Here we show in the Hodgkin \& Huxley model of the action potential and in experiments on squid giant axons that: 1) spike generation in a neuron can be highly discriminatory for stimulus shape and 2) the optimal stimulus shape is dependent upon inputs to the neuron. We show how polarity and time course of postsynaptic currents determine which of these optimal stimulus shapes best excites the neuron. These results are obtained mathematically using the calculus of variations and experimentally using a stochastic search methodology. Our findings reveal a surprising complexity of computation at the single cell level that may be relevant for understanding optimization of signaling in neurons and neuronal networks.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are being increasingly employed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. By taking into account the full spatial pattern of brain activity measured simultaneously at many locations, these methods allow detecting subtle, non-strictly localized effects that may remain invisible to the conventional analysis with univariate statistical methods. In typical fMRI applications, pattern recognition algorithms ``learn'' a functional relationship between brain response patterns and a perceptual, cognitive or behavioral state of a subject expressed in terms of a label, which may assume discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) values. This learned functional relationship is then used to predict the unseen labels from a new data set (``brain reading''). In this article, we describe the mathematical foundations of machine learning applications in fMRI. We focus on two methods, support vector machines and relevance vector machines, which are respectively suited for the classification and regression of fMRI patterns. Furthermore, by means of several examples and applications, we illustrate and discuss the methodological challenges of using machine learning algorithms in the context of fMRI data analysis.},

	Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the treatment of a wide range of neurological disorders. Historically, DBS and other neurostimulation technologies have relied on rectangular stimulation waveforms to impose their effects on the nervous system. Recent work has suggested that non-rectangular waveforms may have advantages over the traditional rectangular pulse. Therefore, we used detailed computer models to compare a range of charge-balanced biphasic waveforms with rectangular, exponential, triangular, Gaussian and sinusoidal stimulus pulse shapes. We explored the neural activation energy of these waveforms for both intracellular and extracellular current-controlled stimulation conditions. In the context of extracellular stimulation, we compared their effects on both axonal fibers of passage and projection neurons. Finally, we evaluated the impact of delivering the waveforms through a clinical DBS electrode, as opposed to a theoretical point source. Our results suggest that DBS with a 1 ms centered-triangular pulse can decrease energy consumption by 64\% when compared with the standard 100 {$\mu$}s rectangular pulse (energy cost of 48 and 133 nJ, respectively, to stimulate 50\% of a distributed population of axons) and can decrease energy consumption by 10\% when compared with the most energy efficient rectangular pulse (1.25 ms duration). In turn, there may be measureable energy savings when using appropriately designed non-rectangular pulses in clinical DBS applications, thereby warranting further experimental investigation.},

	Abstract = {Evidence has amassed from both animal intracranial recordings and human electrophysiology that neural oscillatory mechanisms play a critical role in a number of cognitive functions such as learning, memory, feature binding and sensory gating. The wide availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings (64\textendash{}256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these rhythms. A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the context. Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of alpha-band oscillatory activity (8\textendash{}14 Hz) as a potential attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current review. We discuss findings in the context of intersensory selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile domains. The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information. That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional suppression mechanism when objects or features need to be specifically ignored or selected against.},

	Abstract = {Using deep neural nets as function approximator for reinforcement learning tasks have recently been shown to be very powerful for solving problems approaching real-world complexity such as [1]. Using these results as a benchmark, we discuss the role that the discount factor may play in the quality of the learning process of a deep Q-network (DQN). When the discount factor progressively increases up to its final value, we empirically show that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of learning steps. When used in conjunction with a varying learning rate, we empirically show that it outperforms original DQN on several experiments. We relate this phenomenon with the instabilities of neural networks when they are used in an approximate Dynamic Programming setting. We also describe the possibility to fall within a local optimum during the learning process, thus connecting our discussion with the exploration/exploitation dilemma.},

	Abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) coordinate decision making processes by facilitating adaptive frontal motor commands while suppressing others. In previous work, neural network simulations accounted for response selection deficits associated with BG dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease. Novel predictions from this model have been subsequently confirmed in Parkinson patients and in healthy participants under pharmacological challenge. Nevertheless, one clear limitation of that model is in its omission of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a key BG structure that participates in both motor and cognitive processes. The present model incorporates the STN and shows that by modulating when a response is executed, the STN reduces premature responding and therefore has substantial effects on which response is ultimately selected, particularly when there are multiple competing responses. Increased cortical response conflict leads to dynamic adjustments in response thresholds via cortico-subthalamicpallidal pathways. The model accurately captures the dynamics of activity in various BG areas during response selection. Simulated dopamine depletion results in emergent oscillatory activity in BG structures, which has been linked with Parkinson's tremor. Finally, the model accounts for the beneficial effects of STN lesions on these oscillations, but suggests that this benefit may come at the expense of impaired decision making.},

	Abstract = {Homeostatic signaling systems are thought to interface with the mechanisms of neural plasticity to achieve stable yet flexible neural circuitry. However, the time course, molecular design, and implementation of homeostatic signaling remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that a homeostatic increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release can be induced within minutes following postsynaptic glutamate receptor blockade. The rapid induction of synaptic homeostasis is independent of new protein synthesis and does not require evoked neurotransmission, indicating that a change in the efficacy of spontaneous quantal release events is sufficient to trigger the induction of synaptic homeostasis. Finally, both the rapid induction and the sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis are blocked by mutations that disrupt the pore-forming subunit of the presynaptic CaV2.1 calcium channel encoded by cacophony. These data confirm the presynaptic expression of synaptic homeostasis and implicate presynaptic CaV2.1 in a homeostatic retrograde signaling system.},

	Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is organized hierarchically, with more anterior regions having increasingly abstract representations. How does this organization support hierarchical cognitive control and the rapid discovery of abstract action rules? We present computational models at different levels of description. A neural circuit model simulates interacting corticostriatal circuits organized hierarchically. In each circuit the basal ganglia (BG) gate frontal actions, with some striatal units gating the inputs to PFC, and others gating the outputs to influence response selection. Learning at all of these levels is accomplished via dopaminergic reward prediction error signals in each corticostriatal circuit. This functionality allows the system to exhibit conditional if-then hypothesis testing and to learn rapidly in environments with hierarchical structure. We also develop a hybrid Bayesian-RL mixture of experts (MoE) model, which can estimate the most likely hypothesis state of individual participants based on their observed sequence of choices and rewards. This model yields accurate probabilistic estimates about which hypotheses are attended by manipulating attentional states in the generative neural model and recovering them with the MoE model. This two-pronged modeling approach leads to multiple quantitative predictions that are tested with fMRI in the companion paper.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal oscillations are a characteristic feature of neuronal activity and are typically investigated through measures of power and coherence. However, neither of these measures directly reflects the distinctive feature of oscillations: their rhythmicity. Rhythmicity is the extent to which future phases can be predicted from the present one. Here, we present lagged coherence, a frequency-indexed measure that quantifies the rhythmicity of neuronal activity. We use this method to identify the sensorimotor alpha and beta rhythms in ongoing magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, and to study their attentional modulation. Using lagged coherence, the sensorimotor rhythms become visible in ongoing activity as local rhythmicity peaks that are separated from the strong posterior activity in the same frequency bands. In contrast, using conventional power analyses, the sensorimotor rhythms cannot be identified in ongoing data, nor can they be separated from the posterior activity. We go on to show that the attentional modulation of these rhythms is also evident in lagged coherence and moreover, that in contrast to power, it can be visualised even without an experimental contrast. These findings suggest that the rhythmicity of neuronal activity is better suited to identify neuronal oscillations than the power in the same frequency band.},

	Abstract = {This paper offers an active inference account of choice behaviour and learning. It focuses on the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behaviour and how they contextualise each other. We show that habits emerge naturally (and autodidactically) from sequential policy optimisation when agents are equipped with state-action policies. In active inference, behaviour has explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to ambiguity and risk respectively, where epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) behaviour enables pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviour and the subsequent emergence of habits. Although goal-directed and habitual policies are usually associated with model-based and model-free schemes, we find the more important distinction is between belief-free and belief-based schemes. The underlying (variational) belief updating provides a comprehensive (if metaphorical) process theory for several phenomena, including the transfer of dopamine responses, reversal learning, habit formation and devaluation. Finally, we show that active inference reduces to a classical (Bellman) scheme, in the absence of ambiguity.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge Distillation (KD) consists of transferring ``knowledge'' from one machine learning model (the teacher) to another (the student). Commonly, the teacher is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student is more compact. By transferring knowledge, one hopes to benefit from the student's compactness, without sacrificing too much performance. We study KD from a new perspective: rather than compressing models, we train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly, these Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly, both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs based on DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 (3.5\%) and CIFAR-100 (15.5\%) datasets, by validation error. Additional experiments explore two distillation objectives: (i) Confidence-Weighted by Teacher Max (CWTM) and (ii) Dark Knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP). Both methods elucidate the essential components of KD, demonstrating the effect of the teacher outputs on both predicted and nonpredicted classes.},

	Abstract = {Cellular information processing is generally attributed to the complex networks of genes and proteins that regulate cell behavior. It is still unclear, however, what are the main features of those networks that allow a cell to encode and interpret its ever changing environment. Here we address this question by studying the computational capabilities of the transcriptional regulatory networks of five evolutionary distant organisms. We identify in all cases a cyclic recurrent structure, formed by a small core of genes, that is essential for dynamical encoding and information integration. The recent history of the cell is encoded by the transient dynamics of this recurrent reservoir of nodes, while the rest of the network forms a readout layer devoted to decode and interpret the highdimensional dynamical state of the recurrent core. This separation of roles allows for the integration of temporal information, while facilitating the learning of new environmental conditions and preventing catastrophic interference between those new inputs and the previously stored information. This resembles the reservoir-computing paradigm recently proposed in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Our results reveal that gene regulatory networks act as echo-state networks that perform optimally in standard memory-demanding tasks, and confirms that most of their memory resides in the recurrent reservoir. We also show that the readout layer can learn to decode the information stored in the reservoir via standard evolutionary strategies. Our work thus suggests that recurrent dynamics is a key element for the processing of complex time-dependent information by cells.},

	Abstract = {Recent proposals suggest that large, generic neuronal networks could store memory traces of past input sequences in their instantaneous state. Such a proposal raises important theoretical questions about the duration of these memory traces and their dependence on network size, connectivity and signal statistics. Prior work, in the case of gaussian input sequences and linear neuronal networks, shows that the duration of memory traces in a network cannot exceed the number of neurons (in units of the neuronal time constant), and that no network can out-perform an equivalent feedforward network. However a more ethologically relevant scenario is that of sparse input sequences. In this scenario, we show how linear neural networks can essentially perform compressed sensing (CS) of past inputs, thereby attaining a memory capacity that exceeds the number of neurons. This enhanced capacity is achieved by a class of ``orthogonal'' recurrent networks and not by feedforward networks or generic recurrent networks. We exploit techniques from the statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically compute the decay of memory traces in such networks as a function of network size, signal sparsity and integration time. Alternately, viewed purely from the perspective of CS, this work introduces a new ensemble of measurement matrices derived from dynamical systems, and provides a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic performance.},

Dimensionality reduction methods reveal a striking simplicity underlying such multi-neuronal data: they can be reduced to a low-dimensional space, and the resulting neural trajectories in this space yield a remarkably insightful dynamical portrait of circuit computation. This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons? We present a theory that answers these questions, and test it using physiological recordings from reaching monkeys. This theory reveals conceptual insights into how task complexity governs both neural dimensionality and accurate recovery of dynamic portraits, thereby providing quantitative guidelines for future large-scale experimental design.},

	Abstract = {Human visual object recognition is typically rapid and seemingly effortless, as well as largely independent of viewpoint and object orientation. Until very recently, animate visual systems were the only ones capable of this remarkable computational feat. This has changed with the rise of a class of computer vision algorithms called deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieve human-level classification performance on object recognition tasks. Furthermore, a growing number of studies report similarities in the way DNNs and the human visual system process objects, suggesting that current DNNs may be good models of human visual object recognition. Yet there clearly exist important architectural and processing differences between stateof-the-art DNNs and the primate visual system. The potential behavioural consequences of these differences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing human and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the human visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast reduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find progressively diverging classification error-patterns between man and DNNs when the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked differences in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object recognition. We envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured and freely available behavioural datasets1 provide a new useful benchmark for the computer vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a motivation for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could facilitate this robustness.},

We introduce a simple modification for autoencoder neural networks that yields powerful generative models. Our method masks the autoencoder's parameters to respect autoregressive constraints: each input is reconstructed only from previous inputs in a given ordering. Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with stateof-the-art tractable distribution estimators. At test time, the method is significantly faster and scales better than other autoregressive estimators.},

	Abstract = {Prolonged viewing of a stimulus results in a subsequent perceptual bias [1\textendash{}3]. This perceptual adaptation and the resulting aftereffect reveal important characteristics regarding how perceptual systems are tuned [2, 4\textendash{}6]. These aftereffects occur not only for simple stimulus features but also for high-level stimulus properties [7\textendash{}10]. Here we report a novel cross-category adaptation aftereffect demonstrating that prolonged viewing of a human body without a face shifts the perceptual tuning curve for face gender and face identity. This contradicts a central assumption underlying perceptual adaptation: that adaptation depends on physical similarity between how the adapting and the adapted features are perceived [5]. Additionally, this aftereffect was not due to response bias, because its dependence on adaptation duration resembled traditional perceptual aftereffects. These body-to-face adaptation results demonstrate that bodies alone can alter the tuning properties of neurons that code for the gender and identity of faces. More generally, these results reveal that high-level perceptual adaptation can occur when the property or features being adapted are automatically inferred rather than perceived in the adapting stimulus.},

	Abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded through electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show that oscillations in the beta frequency range (8\textendash{}20 Hz) decrease after levodopa intake. Whether and how DBS influences the beta oscillations and whether levodopa- and DBS-induced changes interact remains unclear. We examined the combined effect of levodopa and DBS on subthalamic beta LFP oscillations, recorded in nine patients with PD under four experimental conditions: without levodopa with DBS turned off; without levodopa with DBS turned on; with levodopa with DBS turned on; and with levodopa with DBS turned off. The analysis of STNLFP oscillations showed that whereas levodopa abolished beta STN oscillations in all the patients (p = 0.026), DBS significantly decreased the beta oscillation only in five of the nine patients studied (p = 0.043). Another difference was that whereas levodopa completely suppressed beta oscillations, DBS merely decreased them. When we combined levodopa and DBS, the levodopa-induced beta disruption prevailed and combining levodopa and DBS induced no significant additive effect (p = 0.500). Our observations suggest that levodopa and DBS both modulate LFP beta oscillations.},

	Abstract = {The active electrical properties of dendrites shape neuronal input and output and are fundamental to brain function. However, our knowledge of active dendrites has been almost entirely acquired from studies of rodents. In this work, we investigated the dendrites of layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the human cerebral cortex ex vivo. In these neurons, we discovered a class of calcium-mediated dendritic action potentials (dCaAPs) whose waveform and effects on neuronal output have not been previously described. In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, dCaAPs were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli. These dCaAPs enabled the dendrites of individual human neocortical pyramidal neurons to classify linearly nonseparable inputs\textemdash{}a computation conventionally thought to require multilayered networks.},

	Abstract = {A coherent set of models is presented that provide novel and testable predictions about the functional role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the basal ganglia. The STN is emerging as an important target for novel therapeutic strategies for the alleviation of Parkinsonian type symptoms [Lancet 345 (1995) 91; Science 249 (1990) 1436]. Computational and mathematical models based on the properties of the STN and its interactions are reviewed. These models focus on core anatomical and physiological data that span many levels. By assessing models of anatomy, dynamic network models, and a detailed model of a recent pharmacological experiment, we can expose the primary modes of STN function and highlight their underlying properties. We show that the presence of functional interactions between STN projection neurons is critical in defining its behaviour and how it interacts with other basal ganglia nuclei. Pulses or switch-like activity patterns emerge in the models as a consequence of these local interactions. Furthermore, the models demonstrate that this behaviour can break down under abnormal conditions resulting in low frequency bursting oscillations. Such oscillations may play a role in symptoms of Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {Background: Fourier-based techniques are used abundantly in the analysis of electrophysiological data. However, these techniques are of limited value when the signal of interest is non-sinusoidal or nonperiodic. New method: We present sliding window matching (SWM): a new data-driven method for discovering recurring temporal patterns in electrophysiological data. SWM is effective in detecting recurring but unknown patterns even when they appear non-periodically.
Results: To demonstrate this, we used SWM on oscillations in local field potential (LFP) recordings from the rat hippocampus and monkey V1. The application of SWM yielded two interesting findings. We could show that rat hippocampal theta and monkey V1 gamma oscillations were both skewed (i.e. asymmetric in time), rather than being sinusoidal. Furthermore, gamma oscillations in monkey V1 were skewed differently in the superficial compared to the deeper cortical layers. Second, we used SWM to analyze responses evoked by stimuli or microsaccades even when the onset timing of stimulus or microsaccades was unknown.
Comparison with existing methods: We first validated the method on simulated datasets, and we checked that for recordings with a sufficiently low noise level the SWM results were consistent with results from the widely used phase alignment (PA) method.
Conclusions: We conclude that the proposed method has wide applicability in the exploration of noisy time series data where the onset times of particular events are unknown by the experimenter such as in resting state and sleep recordings.},

We use here a multi-disciplinary approach at the convergence of neuroscience, dynamical system theory and autonomous robotics, in order to propose an efficient action selection mechanism based on a new model of the basal ganglia. We first describe new developments of contraction theory regarding locally projected dynamical systems. We exploit these results to design a stable computational model of the cortico-baso-thalamo-cortical loops. Based on recent anatomical data, we include usually neglected neural projections, which participate in performing accurate selection. Finally, the efficiency of this model as an autonomous robot action selection mechanism is assessed in a standard survival task. The model exhibits valuable dithering avoidance and energy-saving properties, when compared with a simple if-then-else decision rule.},

	Abstract = {Zero-lag synchronization between distant cortical areas has been observed in a diversity of experimental data sets and between many different regions of the brain. Several computational mechanisms have been proposed to account for such isochronous synchronization in the presence of long conduction delays: Of these, the phenomenon of ``dynamical relaying'' \textendash{}a mechanism that relies on a specific network motif \textendash{} has proven to be the most robust with respect to parameter mismatch and system noise. Surprisingly, despite a contrary belief in the community, the common driving motif is an unreliable means of establishing zero-lag synchrony. Although dynamical relaying has been validated in empirical and computational studies, the deeper dynamical mechanisms and comparison to dynamics on other motifs is lacking. By systematically comparing synchronization on a variety of small motifs, we establish that the presence of a single reciprocally connected pair \textendash{} a ``resonance pair'' \textendash{} plays a crucial role in disambiguating those motifs that foster zero-lag synchrony in the presence of conduction delays (such as dynamical relaying) from those that do not (such as the common driving triad). Remarkably, minor structural changes to the common driving motif that incorporate a reciprocal pair recover robust zerolag synchrony. The findings are observed in computational models of spiking neurons, populations of spiking neurons and neural mass models, and arise whether the oscillatory systems are periodic, chaotic, noise-free or driven by stochastic inputs. The influence of the resonance pair is also robust to parameter mismatch and asymmetrical time delays amongst the elements of the motif. We call this manner of facilitating zero-lag synchrony resonance-induced synchronization, outline the conditions for its occurrence, and propose that it may be a general mechanism to promote zero-lag synchrony in the brain.},

	Abstract = {Connectomes derived from volume EM imaging of the brain can generate detailed physical models of every neuron, and simulators such as NEURON or GENESIS are designed to work with such models. In principal, combining these technologies, plus transmitter and channel models, should allow detailed and accurate simulation of real neural circuits. Here we experiment with this combination, using a well-studied system (motion detection in
            Drosophila
            ). Since simulation requires both the physical geometry (which we have) and the models of the synapses (which are not currently available), we built approximate synapses corresponding to their known and estimated function. Once we did so, we reproduced direction selectivity in T4 cells, one of the main functions of this neural circuit. This verified the basic functionality of both extraction and simulations, and provided a biologically relevant computation we could use in further experiments. We then compared models with different degrees of physical realism, from full detailed models down to models consisting of a single node, to examine the tradeoff of simulation resources required versus accuracy achieved.
          
          
            Our results show that much simpler models may be adequate, at least in the case of medulla neurons in
            Drosophila
            . Such models can be easily derived from fully detailed models, and result in simulations that are much smaller, much faster, and accurate enough for many purposes. Biologically, we show that a lumped neuron model reproduces the main motion detector operation, confirming the result of Gruntman[1], that dendritic compution is not required for this function.},

	Abstract = {In natural behaviour, animals actively interrogate their environments using endogenously generated `question-and-answer' strategies. However, in laboratory settings participants typically engage with externally imposed stimuli and tasks, and the mechanisms of active sampling remain poorly understood. We review a nascent neuroscientific literature that examines active-sampling policies and their relation to attention and curiosity. We distinguish between information sampling, in which organisms reduce uncertainty relevant to a familiar task{$\mkern1mu$}, and information search, in which they investigate in an open-ended fashion to discover new tasks. We review evidence that both sampling and search depend on individual preferences over cognitive states, including attitudes towards uncertainty{$\mkern1mu$}, learning progress and types of information. We propose that, although these preferences are non-instrumental and can on occasion interfere with external goals, they are important heuristics that allow organisms to cope with the high complexity of both sampling and search, and generate curiosity-driven investigations in large, open environments in which rewards are sparse and ex ante unknown.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
          Based on rodent models, researchers have theorized that the hippocampus supports episodic memory and navigation via the theta oscillation, a \textasciitilde{}4\textendash{}10-Hz rhythm that coordinates brain-wide neural activity. However, recordings from humans have indicated that hippocampal theta oscillations are lower in frequency and less prevalent than in rodents, suggesting interspecies differences in theta's function. To characterize human hippocampal theta, we examined the properties of theta oscillations throughout the anterior\textendash{}posterior length of the hippocampus as neurosurgical subjects performed a virtual spatial navigation task. During virtual movement, we observed hippocampal oscillations at multiple frequencies from 2 to 14 Hz. The posterior hippocampus prominently displayed oscillations at \textasciitilde{}8-Hz and the precise frequency of these oscillations correlated with the speed of movement, implicating these signals in spatial navigation. We also observed slower \textasciitilde{}3-Hz oscillations, but these signals were more prevalent in the anterior hippocampus and their frequency did not vary with movement speed. Our results converge with recent findings to suggest an updated view of human hippocampal electrophysiology. Rather than one hippocampal theta oscillation with a single general role, high-and low-theta oscillations, respectively, may reflect spatial and non-spatial cognitive processes.},

	Abstract = {A new model of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is presented that integrates volume conduction effects with a neural model of pathological beta-band oscillations in the cortico-basal ganglia network. The model is used to test the clinical hypothesis that closed-loop control of the amplitude of DBS may be possible, based on the average rectified value of beta-band oscillations in the local field potential. Simulation of closed-loop high-frequency DBS was shown to yield energy savings, with the magnitude of the energy saved dependent on the strength of coupling between the subthalamic nucleus and the remainder of the cortico-basal ganglia network. When closed-loop DBS was applied to a strongly coupled cortico-basal ganglia network, the stimulation energy delivered over a 480 s period was reduced by up to 42\%. Greater energy reductions were observed for weakly coupled networks, as the stimulation amplitude reduced to zero once the initial desynchronization had occurred. The results provide support for the application of closed-loop high-frequency DBS based on electrophysiological biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {Non-player characters (NPCs) in games are traditionally hard-coded or dependent on pre-specified goals, and consequently struggle to behave sensibly in ever-changing and possibly unpredictable game worlds. To make them fit for new developments in procedural content generation, we introduce the principle of Coupled Empowerment Maximisation as an intrinsic motivation for game NPCs. We focus on the development of a general game companion, designed to support the player in achieving their goals. We evaluate our approach against three intuitive and abstract companion duties. We develop dedicated scenarios for each duty in a dungeon-crawler game testbed, and provide qualitative evidence that the emergent NPC behaviour fulfils these duties. We argue that this generic approach can speed up NPC AI development, improve automatic game evolution and introduce NPCs to full game-generation systems.},

Encoding models typically comprise a nonlinear transformation of stimuli to features (feature model) and a linear transformation of features to responses (response model). While there has been extensive work on developing better feature models, the work on developing better response models has been rather limited. Here, we investigate the extent to which recurrent neural network models can use their internal memories for nonlinear processing of arbitrary feature sequences to predict feature-evoked response sequences as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that the proposed recurrent neural network models can significantly outperform established response models by accurately estimating long-term dependencies that drive hemodynamic responses. The results open a new window into modeling the dynamics of brain activity in response to sensory stimuli.},

However, it is unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that deep learning can be achieved by moving away from point neuron models and towards multi-compartment neurons. Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive feedforward sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, the network can calculate local synaptic weight updates that allow it to categorize images from the MNIST data-set with good accuracy. We show that our learning algorithm can take advantage of multilayer architectures to identify abstract categories\textemdash{}the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments for feedforward and feedback information, which may help to explain the dendritic morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons.},

	Abstract = {The success of fMRI places constraints on the nature of the neural code. The fact that researchers can infer similarities between neural representations, despite limitations in what fMRI measures, implies that certain neural coding schemes are more likely than others. For fMRI to be successful given its low temporal and spatial resolution, the neural code must smooth at the subvoxel and functional level such that similar stimuli engender similar internal representations. Through proof and simulation, we evaluate a number of reasonable coding schemes and demonstrate that only a subset are plausible given both fMRI's successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity. Deep neural network approaches, which have been forwarded as computational accounts of the ventral stream, are consistent with the success of fMRI, though functional smoothness breaks down in the later network layers. These results have implications for the nature of neural code and ventral stream, as well as what can be successfully investigated with fMRI.},

	Abstract = {In this essay I will sketch some ideas for how to think about models in biology. I will begin by trying to dispel the myth that quantitative modeling is somehow foreign to biology. I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as `predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

We explore the personality psychology and decision making literatures and conclude that these individual differences are likely to be mediated by differential emotional arousal. We argue that Christie and Geis's Machiavellianism scale (Mach-IV) is an instrument that allows the identification of types who vary in cooperativeness. We use that test to predict the behavior of participants in a two-person one-shot constituent game in which subjects face a choice between trust and distrust, and between reciprocation (trustworthiness) and defection. We find that the Mach-IV scale does not predict trusting behavior. It does, however, predict reciprocity. Over one half of those who score low to average on the scale reciprocate trust. High scorers overwhelmingly defect when it is to their advantage to do so. {\'O} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, we present a linear model of shared representational spaces in human cortex that captures fine-scale distinctions among population responses with response-tuning basis functions that are common across brains and models cortical patterns of neural responses with individual-specific topographic basis functions. We derive a common model space for the whole cortex using a new algorithm, searchlight hyperalignment, and complex, dynamic stimuli that provide a broad sampling of visual, auditory, and social percepts. The model aligns representations across brains in occipital, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as shown by between-subject multivariate pattern classification and intersubject correlation of representational geometry, indicating that structural principles for shared neural representations apply across widely divergent domains of information. The model provides a rigorous account for individual variability of well-known coarse-scale topographies, such as retinotopy and category selectivity, and goes further to account for fine-scale patterns that are multiplexed with coarse-scale topographies and carry finer distinctions.},

	Abstract = {We develop a methodology for testing computational hypotheses about neural functionality articulated in models at the systems level of description. In this approach, the first step is to attempt the construction of a model of the underlying brain system which is consistent with the known anatomy and physiology, but which is also able to exhibit functional properties consistent with a putative computational hypothesis. If this is successful, the second step consists of including additional known pathways into the model and testing the new models to see whether they show an improvement in functional performance (using appropriate performance metrics). A positive outcome is taken as evidence in support of the hypothesis. A final step is to construct `control' models by including pathways that are not consistent with biological data. In this case a performance detriment is taken as support for the hypothesis. The methodology is applied to the basal ganglia, and builds on a previously published model of this system (Gurney et al 2001 Biol. Cybern. 84 401\textendash{}23) which was based on the hypothesis that the basal ganglia perform action selection. The realistically constrained models show a selection benefit, while control models show a decrement in selection ability.

The generic properties of signal selection are de\textregistered{}ned and neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into `selection' and `control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection per se via a feedforward o-centre on-surround network. The control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its eective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic modulation.

The decomposition of the basal ganglia into selection and control pathways is supported in several ways. First, several elegant features are exposed {$\pm$} capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation {$\pm$} which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and biological basal ganglia.

	Abstract = {Operant learning requires that reinforcement signals interact with action representations at a suitable neural interface. Much evidence suggests that this occurs when phasic dopamine, acting as a reinforcement prediction error, gates plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses, and thereby changes the future likelihood of selecting the action(s) coded by striatal neurons. But this hypothesis faces serious challenges. First, cortico-striatal plasticity is inexplicably complex, depending on spike timing, dopamine level, and dopamine receptor type. Second, there is a credit assignment problem\textemdash{}action selection signals occur long before the consequent dopamine reinforcement signal. Third, the two types of striatal output neuron have apparently opposite effects on action selection. Whether these factors rule out the interface hypothesis and how they interact to produce reinforcement learning is unknown. We present a computational framework that addresses these challenges. We first predict the expected activity changes over an operant task for both types of action-coding striatal neuron, and show they co-operate to promote action selection in learning and compete to promote action suppression in extinction. Separately, we derive a complete model of dopamine and spike-timing dependent cortico-striatal plasticity from in vitro data. We then show this model produces the predicted activity changes necessary for learning and extinction in an operant task, a remarkable convergence of a bottom-up data-driven plasticity model with the top-down behavioural requirements of learning theory. Moreover, we show the complex dependencies of cortico-striatal plasticity are not only sufficient but necessary for learning and extinction. Validating the model, we show it can account for behavioural data describing extinction, renewal, and reacquisition, and replicate in vitro experimental data on cortico-striatal plasticity. By bridging the levels between the single synapse and behaviour, our model shows how striatum acts as the action-reinforcement interface.},

One of the fundamental questions posed by these rhythms is how individual neurons or groups of neurons are recruited into different network oscillations. We modeled competing fast and slow oscillators connected to a hub neuron with electrical and inhibitory synapses. We explore the patterns of coordination shown in the network as a function of the electrical coupling and inhibitory synapse strengths with the help of a novel visualization method that we call the ``parameterscape.'' The hub neuron can be switched between the fast and slow oscillators by multiple network mechanisms, indicating that a given change in network state can be achieved by degenerate cellular mechanisms.

We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.},

Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

	Abstract = {With rapidly advancing multi-electrode recording technology, the local field potential (LFP) has again become a popular measure of neuronal activity in both research and clinical applications. Proper understanding of the LFP requires detailed mathematical modeling incorporating the anatomical and electrophysiological features of neurons near the recording electrode, as well as synaptic inputs from the entire network. Here we propose a hybrid modeling scheme combining efficient point-neuron network models with biophysical principles underlying LFP generation by real neurons. The LFP predictions rely on populations of network-equivalent multicompartment neuron models with layer-specific synaptic connectivity, can be used with an arbitrary number of point-neuron network populations, and allows for a full separation of simulated network dynamics and LFPs. We apply the scheme to a full-scale cortical network model for a {$\sim$}1 mm2 patch of primary visual cortex, predict laminar LFPs for different network states, assess the relative LFP contribution from different laminar populations, and investigate effects of input correlations and neuron density on the LFP. The generic nature of the hybrid scheme and its public implementation in hybridLFPy form the basis for LFP predictions from other and larger pointneuron network models, as well as extensions of the current application with additional biological detail.},

	Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthlamic nucleus (STN) represents an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease; however, understanding of its effects on basal ganglia network activity remains limited. We constructed a computational model of the subthalamopallidal network, trained it to fit in vivo recordings from parkinsonian monkeys, and evaluated its response to STN DBS. The network model was created with synaptically connected single compartment biophysical models of STN and pallidal neurons, and stochastically defined inputs driven by cortical beta rhythms. A least mean square error training algorithm was developed to parameterize network connections and minimize error when compared to experimental spike and burst rates in the parkinsonian condition. The output of the trained network was then compared to experimental data not used in the training process. We found that reducing the influence of the cortical beta input on the model generated activity that agreed well with recordings from normal monkeys. Further, during STN DBS in the parkinsonian condition the simulations reproduced the reduction in GPi bursting found in existing experimental data. The model also provided the opportunity to greatly expand analysis of GPi bursting activity, generating three major predictions. First, its reduction was proportional to the volume of STN activated by DBS. Second, GPi bursting decreased in a stimulation frequency dependent manner, saturating at values consistent with clinically therapeutic DBS. And third, ablating STN neurons, reported to generate similar therapeutic outcomes as STN DBS, also reduced GPi bursting. Our theoretical analysis of stimulation induced network activity suggests that regularization of GPi firing is dependent on the volume of STN tissue activated and a threshold level of burst reduction may be necessary for therapeutic effect.},

In this study, we used micro and macro electrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in posterior cortex propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas towards the occipital pole, consistent with alpha effecting top-down processing. This cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback which propagates from higher to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.},

	Abstract = {Background: The hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal neurons supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.
Results: Here, by using multivariate pattern classification and high spatial resolution functional MRI, we decoded activity across the population of neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while participants navigated in a virtual reality environment. Remarkably, we could accurately predict the position of an individual within this environment solely from the pattern of activity in his hippocampus even when visual input and task were held constant. Moreover, we observed a dissociation between responses in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, suggesting that they play differing roles in navigation.
Conclusions: These results show that highly abstracted representations of space are expressed in the human hippocampus. Furthermore, our findings have implications for understanding the hippocampal population code and suggest that, contrary to current consensus, neuronal ensembles representing place memories must be large and have an anisotropic structure.},

@article{Hassinger1995,
	Abstract = {Communication from astrocytes to neurons has recently been reported by two laboratories, but different mechanisms were thought to underlie glial calcium wave activation of associated neurons. Neuronal calcium elevation by glia observed in the present report is similar to that reported previously, where an increase in neuronal calcium was demonstrated in response to glial stimulation. In the present study hippocampal neurons plated on a confluent glial monolayer displayed a transient increase in intracellular calcium following a short delay after the passage of a wave of increased calcium in underlying glia. Activated cells displayed action potentials in response to glial waves and showed antineurofilament immunoreactivity. Finally, the N-methyl+-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist \textasciitilde{}r,-2-amino-5-phosphonovalericacid and the non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist 6,7dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione significantly reduced the responsiveness of neurons to glial calcium waves. O u r results indicate that hippocampal neurons growing on hippocampal or cortical astrocytes respond to glial calcium waves with elevations in calcium and increased electrical activity. Furthermore, we show that in most cases this communication appears to be mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptor channels. 01995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Focally evoked calcium waves in astrocyte cultures have been thought to propagate by gap-junctionmediated intercellular passage of chemical signal(s). In contrast to this mechanism we observed isolated astrocytes, which had no physical contact with other astrocytes in the culture, participating in a calcium wave. This observation requires an extracellular route of astrocyte signaling. To directly test for extracellular signaling we made cell-free lanes 10\textendash{}300 ␮m wide in conf luent cultures by deleting astrocytes with a glass pipette. After 4\textendash{}8 hr of recovery, regions of conf luent astrocytes separated by lanes devoid of cells were easily located. Electrical stimulation was used to initiate calcium waves. Waves crossed narrow ({$<$}120 ␮m) cell-free lanes in 15 of 36 cases, but failed to cross lanes wider than 120 ␮m in eight of eight cases. The probability of crossing narrow lanes was not correlated with the distance from the stimulation site, suggesting that cells along the path of the calcium wave release the extracellular messenger(s). Calculated velocity across the acellular lanes was not significantly different from velocity through regions of conf luent astrocytes. Focal superfusion altered both the extent and the direction of calcium waves in conf luent regions. These data indicate that extracellular signals may play a role in astrocyte\textendash{}astrocyte communication in situ.},

	Abstract = {Accumulating evidence across species indicates that brain oscillations are superimposed upon an aperiodic 1/f - like power spectrum. Maturational changes in neuronal oscillations have not been assessed in tandem with this underlying aperiodic spectrum. The current study uncovers co-maturation of the aperiodic component alongside the periodic components (oscillations) in spontaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Beamformer-reconstructed MEG time-series allowed a direct comparison of power in the source domain between 24 children (8.0 {$\pm$} 2.5 years, 17 males) and 24 adults (40.6 {$\pm$} 17.4 years, 16 males). Our results suggest that the redistribution of oscillatory power from lower to higher frequencies that is observed in childhood does not hold once the age-related changes in the aperiodic signal are controlled for. When estimating both the periodic and aperiodic components, we found that power increases with age in the beta band only, and that the 1/f signal is flattened in adults compared to children. These results suggest a pattern of co-maturing beta oscillatory power with the aperiodic 1/f signal in typical childhood development.},

	Abstract = {Oscillatory neuronal synchronization between cortical areas has been suggested to constitute a flexible mechanism to coordinate information flow in the human cerebral cortex. However, it remains unclear whether synchronized neuronal activity merely represents an epiphenomenon or whether it is causally involved in the selective gating of information. Here, we combined bilateral high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) at 40 Hz with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to study immediate electrophysiological effects during the selective entrainment of oscillatory gamma-band signatures. We found that interhemispheric functional connectivity was modulated in a predictable, phase-specific way: In-phase stimulation enhanced synchronization, anti-phase stimulation impaired functional coupling. Perceptual correlates of these connectivity changes were found in an ambiguous motion task, which strongly support the functional relevance of long-range neuronal coupling. Additionally, our results revealed a decrease in oscillatory alpha power in response to the entrainment of gamma band signatures. This finding provides causal evidence for the antagonistic role of alpha and gamma oscillations in the parieto-occipital cortex and confirms that the observed gamma band modulations were physiological in nature. Our results demonstrate that synchronized cortical network activity across several spatiotemporal scales is essential for conscious perception and cognition.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

	Abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that the brain performs probabilistic inference in multiple cognitive domains, including perception and decision making. There is also evidence that probabilistic inference may be implemented in the brain through the (quasi-)stochastic activity of neural circuits, producing samples from the appropriate posterior distributions, effectively implementing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. However, time becomes a fundamental bottleneck in such sampling-based probabilistic representations: the quality of inferences depends on how fast the neural circuit generates new, uncorrelated samples from its stationary distribution (the posterior). We explore this bottleneck in a simple, linear-Gaussian latent variable model, in which posterior sampling can be achieved by stochastic neural networks with linear dynamics. The well-known Langevin sampling (LS) recipe, so far the only sampling algorithm for continuous variables of which a neural implementation has been suggested, naturally fits into this dynamical framework. However, we first show analytically and through simulations that the symmetry of the synaptic weight matrix implied by LS yields critically slow mixing when the posterior is high-dimensional. Next, using methods from control theory, we construct and inspect networks that are optimally fast, and hence orders of magnitude faster than LS, while being far more biologically plausible. In these networks, strong \textendash{} but transient \textendash{} selective amplification of external noise generates the spatially correlated activity fluctuations prescribed by the posterior. Intriguingly, although a detailed balance of excitation and inhibition is dynamically maintained, detailed balance of Markov chain steps in the resulting sampler is violated, consistent with recent findings on how statistical irreversibility can overcome the speed limitation of random walks in other domains.},

@article{Hermes2015,
	Abstract = {A striking feature of some field potential recordings in visual cortex is a rhythmic oscillation within the gamma band (30\textendash{}80 Hz). These oscillations have been proposed to underlie computations in perception, attention, and information transmission. Recent studies of cortical field potentials, including human electrocorticography (ECoG), have emphasized another signal within the gamma band, a nonoscillatory, broadband signal, spanning 80\textendash{}200 Hz. It remains unclear under what conditions gamma oscillations are elicited in visual cortex, whether they are necessary and ubiquitous in visual encoding, and what relationship they have to nonoscillatory, broadband field potentials. We demonstrate that ECoG responses in human visual cortex (V1/V2/V3) can include robust narrowband gamma oscillations, and that these oscillations are reliably elicited by some spatial contrast patterns (luminance gratings) but not by others (noise patterns and many natural images). The gamma oscillations can be conspicuous and robust, but because they are absent for many stimuli, which observers can see and recognize, the oscillations are not necessary for seeing. In contrast, all visual stimuli induced broadband spectral changes in ECoG responses. Asynchronous neural signals in visual cortex, reflected in the broadband ECoG response, can support transmission of information for perception and recognition in the absence of pronounced gamma oscillations.},

	Abstract = {The performance of information processing systems, from artificial neural networks to natural neuronal ensembles, depends heavily on the underlying system architecture. In this study, we compare the performance of parallel and layered network architectures during sequential tasks that require both acquisition and retention of information, thereby identifying tradeoffs between learning and memory processes. During the task of supervised, sequential function approximation, networks produce and adapt representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in these representations while varying the initial network state, the structure of the external information, and the time given to learn the information. We link performance to complexity in network architecture by characterizing local error landscape curvature. We find that variations in error landscape structure give rise to tradeoffs in performance; these include the ability of the network to maximize accuracy versus minimize inaccuracy and produce specific versus generalizable representations of information. Parallel networks generate smooth error landscapes with deep, narrow minima, enabling them to find highly specific representations given sufficient time. While accurate, however, these representations are difficult to generalize. In contrast, layered networks generate rough error landscapes with a variety of local minima, allowing them to quickly find coarse representations. Although less accurate, these representations are easily adaptable. The presence of measurable performance tradeoffs in both layered and parallel networks has implications for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of natural and artificial learning systems.},

@article{Higgins2014,
	Abstract = {Most models of learning and memory assume that memories are maintained in neuronal circuits by persistent synaptic modifications induced by specific patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity. For this scenario to be viable, synaptic modifications must survive the ubiquitous ongoing activity present in neural circuits in vivo. In this paper, we investigate the time scales of memory maintenance in a calcium-based synaptic plasticity model that has been shown recently to be able to fit different experimental data-sets from hippocampal and neocortical preparations. We find that in the presence of background activity on the order of 1 Hz parameters that fit pyramidal layer 5 neocortical data lead to a very fast decay of synaptic efficacy, with time scales of minutes. We then identify two ways in which this memory time scale can be extended: (i) the extracellular calcium concentration in the experiments used to fit the model are larger than estimated concentrations in vivo. Lowering extracellular calcium concentration to in vivo levels leads to an increase in memory time scales of several orders of magnitude; (ii) adding a bistability mechanism so that each synapse has two stable states at sufficiently low background activity leads to a further boost in memory time scale, since memory decay is no longer described by an exponential decay from an initial state, but by an escape from a potential well. We argue that both features are expected to be present in synapses in vivo. These results are obtained first in a single synapse connecting two independent Poisson neurons, and then in simulations of a large network of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons. Our results emphasise the need for studying plasticity at physiological extracellular calcium concentration, and highlight the role of synaptic bi- or multistability in the stability of learned synaptic structures.},

We found V1 neurons' average responses were primarily additive (linear). We used a recurrent cortical network model to determine if these data, as well as past observations of nonlinearity, could be described by a common circuit architecture.  The model showed cortical input-output transformations can be changed from linear to sublinear with moderate (\textasciitilde{}20\%) strengthening of connections between inhibitory neurons, but this change depends on the presence of feedforward inhibition.  Thus, feedforward inhibition, a common feature of cortical circuitry, enables networks to flexibly change their spiking responses via changes in recurrent connectivity.},

	Abstract = {Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment ``input'' to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear statespace feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This ``myopic'' controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control's utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control's utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted betaoscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.},

	Abstract = {Thirty-four years since the small nervous system of the nematode
            C. elegans
            was manually reconstructed in the electron microscope (EM)
            1
            , `high-throughput' EM techniques now enable the dense reconstruction of neural circuits within increasingly large brain volumes at synaptic resolution
            2\textendash{}6
            . As with
            C. elegans
            , however, a key limitation for inferring brain function from neuronal wiring diagrams is that it remains unknown how the structure of a synapse seen in EM relates to its physiological transmission strength. Here, we related structure and function of the same synapses to bridge this gap: we combined paired whole-cell recordings of synaptically connected pyramidal neurons in slices of mouse somatosensory cortex with correlated light microscopy and high-resolution EM of all putative synaptic contacts between the neurons. We discovered a linear relationship between synapse size (postsynaptic density area) and synapse strength (excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude), which provides an experimental foundation for assigning the actual physiological weights to synaptic connections seen in the EM. Furthermore, quantal analysis revealed that the number of vesicle release sites exceeded the number of anatomical synapses formed by a connection by a factor of at least 2.6, which challenges the current understanding of synaptic release in neocortex and suggests that neocortical synapses operate with multivesicular release, like hippocampal synapses
            7\textendash{}11
            . Thus, neocortical synapses are more complex computational devices and may modulate their strength more flexibly than previously thought, with the corollary that the canonical neocortical microcircuitry possesses significantly higher computational power than estimated by current models.},

	Abstract = {Efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) depends in part on post-operative programming of stimulus parameters. There is a need for a systematic approach to tuning parameters based on patient physiology. We used a physiologically realistic computational model of the basal ganglia network to investigate the emergence of a 34 Hz oscillation in the PD state and its optimal suppression with DBS. Discrete time transfer functions were fit to post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) collected in open-loop, by simulating the pharmacological block of synaptic connections, to describe the behavior of the basal ganglia nuclei. These functions were then connected to create a mean-field model of the closed-loop system, which was analyzed to determine the origin of the emergent 34 Hz pathological oscillation. This analysis determined that the oscillation could emerge from the coupling between the globus pallidus external (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). When coupled, the two resonate with each other in the PD state but not in the healthy state. By characterizing how this oscillation is affected by subthreshold DBS pulses, we hypothesize that it is possible to predict stimulus frequencies capable of suppressing this oscillation. To characterize the response to the stimulus, we developed a new method for estimating phase response curves (PRCs) from population data. Using the population PRC we were able to predict frequencies that enhance and suppress the 34 Hz pathological oscillation. This provides a systematic approach to tuning DBS frequencies and could enable closed-loop tuning of stimulation parameters.},

	Abstract = {Innate behavioral biases and preferences can vary significantly among individuals of the same genotype. Though individuality is a fundamental property of behavior, it is not currently understood how individual differences in brain structure and physiology produce idiosyncratic behaviors. Here we present evidence for idiosyncrasy in olfactory behavior and neural responses in
              Drosophila
              . We show that individual female
              Drosophila
              from a highly inbred laboratory strain exhibit idiosyncratic odor preferences that persist for days. We used in vivo calcium imaging of neural responses to compare projection neuron (second-order neurons that convey odor information from the sensory periphery to the central brain) responses to the same odors across animals. We found that, while odor responses appear grossly stereotyped, upon closer inspection, many individual differences are apparent across antennal lobe (AL) glomeruli (compact microcircuits corresponding to different odor channels). Moreover, we show that neuromodulation, environmental stress in the form of altered nutrition, and activity of certain AL local interneurons affect the magnitude of interfly behavioral variability. Taken together, this work demonstrates that individual
              Drosophila
              exhibit idiosyncratic olfactory preferences and idiosyncratic neural responses to odors, and that behavioral idiosyncrasies are subject to neuromodulation and regulation by neurons in the AL.},

Stochastic approximation theory has been used to analyse the local stability of fixed points under this learning process. However, as we show, when such points are on the boundary of the state space, for example, pure strategy equilibria, standard results from the theory of stochastic approximation do not apply. We offer what we believe to be the correct treatment of boundary points, and provide a new and more general result: this model of learning converges with zero probability to fixed points which are unstable under the Maynard Smith or adjusted version of the evolutionary replicator dynamics. For two player games these are the fixed points that are linearly unstable under the standard replicator dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Background: Over the last 15-years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a relatively novel form of neuromodulation, has seen a surge of popularity in both clinical and academic settings. Despite numerous claims suggesting that a single session of tDCS can modulate cognition in healthy adult populations (especially working memory and language production), the paradigms utilized and results reported in the literature are extremely variable. To address this, we conduct the largest quantitative review of the cognitive data to date.
Methods: Single-session tDCS data in healthy adults (18e50) from every cognitive outcome measure reported by at least two different research groups in the literature was collected. Outcome measures were divided into 4 broad categories: executive function, language, memory, and miscellaneous. To account for the paradigmatic variability in the literature, we undertook a three-tier analysis system; each with less-stringent inclusion criteria than the prior. Standard mean difference values with 95\% CIs were generated for included studies and pooled for each analysis.
Results: Of the 59 analyses conducted, tDCS was found to not have a significant effect on any e regardless of inclusion laxity. This includes no effect on any working memory outcome or language production task.
Conclusion: Our quantitative review does not support the idea that tDCS generates a reliable effect on cognition in healthy adults. Reasons for and limitations of this finding are discussed. This work raises important questions regarding the efficacy of tDCS, state-dependency effects, and future directions for this tool in cognitive research.},

	Abstract = {Visual filling-in occurs when a retinally stabilized object undergoes perceptual fading. As the term ``filling-in'' implies, it is commonly believed that information about the apparently vanished object is lost and replaced solely by information arising from the surrounding background. Here we report multivoxel pattern analysis fMRI data that challenge this long-held belief. When subjects view blue disks on a red background while fixating, the stimulus and background appear to turn a uniform purple upon perceptual fading, suggesting that a feature mixing mechanism may underlie color fillingin. We find that ensemble fMRI signals in retinotopic visual areas reliably predict (i) which of three colors a subject reports seeing; (ii) whether a subject is in a perceptually filled-in state or not; and (iii) furthermore, while subjects are in the perceptual state of filling-in, the BOLD signal activation pattern in the sub-areas of V1 corresponding to the location of the blue disks behaves as if subjects are in fact viewing a perceptually mixed color (purple), rather than the color of the disks (blue) or the color of the background (red). These results imply that the mechanism of filling-in in stimuli in which figure and background surfaces are equated is a process of ``feature mixing'', not ``feature replacement''.

This assumption has successfully described neural responses in many systems. The noise in rate coding neurons can be quantified by the coherence function or the correlation coefficient between the neuron's deterministic time-varying mean rate and noise corrupted single spike trains. Because of the finite data size, the mean rate cannot be known exactly and must be approximated. We introduce novel unbiased estimators for the measures of coherence and correlation which are based on the extrapolation of the signal to noise ratio in the neural response to infinite data size. We then describe the application of these estimates to the validation of the class of stimulus\textendash{}response models that assume that the mean firing rate captures all the information embedded in the neural response. We explain how these quantifiers can be used to separate response prediction errors that are due to inaccurate model assumptions from errors due to noise inherent in neuronal spike trains.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsic exploration involves exploratory acts that are not instrumental in achieving any particular goal other than performance of the acts themselves. Of the theories proposed to account for the motivation of intrinsic exploration in animals, concepts of exploratory drive, optimal arousal and fear have featured prominently. But since no single approach has adequate explanatory or predictive power, it is probably sufficient to go no further than accept that organisms may have some type of `need' for sensory change which can be satisfied mainly by intrinsic exploration. Attempts to measure the phenomenon in the laboratory can be divided into forced tests in which locomotion and other motor responses are recorded in animals placed into a totally novel environments, and free tests involving measurements of active choices of differing degrees of novelty. Because of the difficulty of distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic exploration with activity indices, tests of free exploration are always preferable. These include novelty-related location preferences (including spontaneous alternation and responses to brightness change), object exploration and learning for exploratory rewards all of which can be viewed as reasonably valid measures of intrinsic exploration to a greater or lesser extent. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Wave physics, as found in acoustics and optics, is a natural candidate for building analog processors for time-varying signals. Here we identify a mapping between the dynamics of wave physics, and the computation in recurrent neural networks. This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inversely-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio data by simple propagation of waves through such a medium, achieving performance that is comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain.},

	Abstract = {Much of studies on neural computation are based on network models of static neurons that produce analog output, despite the fact that information processing in the brain is predominantly carried out by dynamic neurons that produce discrete pulses called spikes. Research in spike-based computation has been impeded by the lack of efficient supervised learning algorithm for spiking networks. Here, we present a gradient descent method for optimizing spiking network models by introducing a differentiable formulation of spiking networks and deriving the exact gradient calculation. For demonstration, we trained recurrent spiking networks on two dynamic tasks: one that requires optimizing fast ({$\approx$} millisecond) spike-based interactions for efficient encoding of information, and a delayed-memory XOR task over extended duration ({$\approx$} second). The results show that our method indeed optimizes the spiking network dynamics on the time scale of individual spikes as well as the behavioral time scales. In conclusion, our result offers a general purpose supervised learning algorithm for spiking neural networks, thus advancing further investigations on spike-based computation.},

	Abstract = {The striatum, the principal input structure of the basal ganglia, is crucial to both motor control and learning. It receives convergent input from all over the neocortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala and thalamus, and is the primary recipient of dopamine in the brain. Within the striatum is a GABAergic microcircuit that acts upon these inputs, formed by the dominant medium-spiny projection neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). There has been little progress in understanding the computations it performs, hampered by the non-laminar structure that prevents identification of a repeating canonical microcircuit. We here begin the identification of potential dynamically-defined computational elements within the striatum. We construct a new three-dimensional model of the striatal microcircuit's connectivity, and instantiate this with our dopamine-modulated neuron models of the MSNs and FSIs. A new model of gap junctions between the FSIs is introduced and tuned to experimental data. We introduce a novel multiple spike-train analysis method, and apply this to the outputs of the model to find groups of synchronised neurons at multiple time-scales. We find that, with realistic in vivo background input, small assemblies of synchronised MSNs spontaneously appear, consistent with experimental observations, and that the number of assemblies and the time-scale of synchronisation is strongly dependent on the simulated concentration of dopamine. We also show that feed-forward inhibition from the FSIs counter-intuitively increases the firing rate of the MSNs. Such small cell assemblies forming spontaneously only in the absence of dopamine may contribute to motor control problems seen in humans and animals following a loss of dopamine cells.},

	Abstract = {A system's wiring constrains its dynamics, yet modelling of neural structures often overlooks the specific networks formed by their neurons. We developed an approach for constructing anatomically realistic networks and reconstructed the GABAergic microcircuit formed by the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) of the adult rat striatum. We grew dendrite and axon models for these neurons and extracted probabilities for the presence of these neurites as a function of distance from the soma. From these, we found the probabilities of intersection between the neurites of two neurons given their inter-somatic distance, and used these to construct three-dimensional striatal networks. The MSN dendrite models predicted that half of all dendritic spines are within 100mm of the soma. The constructed networks predict distributions of gap junctions between FSI dendrites, synaptic contacts between MSNs, and synaptic inputs from FSIs to MSNs that are consistent with current estimates. The models predict that to achieve this, FSIs should be at most 1\% of the striatal population. They also show that the striatum is sparsely connected: FSI-MSN and MSN-MSN contacts respectively form 7\% and 1.7\% of all possible connections. The models predict two striking network properties: the dominant GABAergic input to a MSN arises from neurons with somas at the edge of its dendritic field; and FSIs are interconnected on two different spatial scales: locally by gap junctions and distally by synapses. We show that both properties influence striatal dynamics: the most potent inhibition of a MSN arises from a region of striatum at the edge of its dendritic field; and the combination of local gap junction and distal synaptic networks between FSIs sets a robust input-output regime for the MSN population. Our models thus intimately link striatal micro-anatomy to its dynamics, providing a biologically grounded platform for further study.},

	Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a remarkably successful treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) within the basal ganglia is a main clinical target, but the physiological mechanisms of therapeutic STN DBS at the cellular and network level are unclear. We set out to begin to address the hypothesis that a mixture of responses in the basal ganglia output nuclei, combining regularized firing and inhibition, is a key contributor to the effectiveness of STN DBS. We used our computational model of the complete basal ganglia circuit to show how such a mixture of responses in basal ganglia output naturally arises from the network effects of STN DBS. We replicated the diversification of responses recorded in a primate STN DBS study to show that the model's predicted mixture of responses is consistent with therapeutic STN DBS. We then showed how this `mixture of response' perspective suggests new ideas for DBS mechanisms: first, that the therapeutic frequency of STN DBS is above 100 Hz because the diversification of responses exhibits a step change above this frequency; and second, that optogenetic models of direct STN stimulation during DBS have proven therapeutically ineffective because they do not replicate the mixture of basal ganglia output responses evoked by electrical DBS.},

	Abstract = {Biological brains can adapt and learn from past experience. In neuroevolution, i.e. evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs), one way that agents controlled by ANNs can evolve the ability to adapt is by encoding local learning rules. However, a significant problem with most such approaches is that local learning rules for every connection in the network must be discovered separately. This paper aims to show that learning rules can be effectively indirectly encoded by extending the Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) method. Adaptive HyperNEAT is introduced to allow not only patterns of weights across the connectivity of an ANN to be generated by a function of its geometry, but also patterns of arbitrary learning rules. Several such adaptive models with different levels of generality are explored and compared. The long-term promise of the new approach is to evolve large-scale adaptive ANNs, which is a major goal for neuroevolution.},

A more efficient scheme would be to represent categories as locations in a continuous semantic space mapped smoothly across the cortical surface. To search for such a space, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure human brain activity evoked by natural movies. We then used voxel-wise models to examine the cortical representation of 1705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals.},

Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo (``particle filtering'') methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximisation. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise.},

	Abstract = {Homeostatic synaptic scaling adjusts a neuron's excitatory synaptic strengths up or down to compensate for perturbations in activity. Little is known about the molecular pathway(s) involved, nor is it clear which aspect of ``activity''\textemdash{}local synaptic signaling, postsynaptic firing, or large-scale changes in network activity\textemdash{}is required to induce synaptic scaling. Here, we selectively block either postsynaptic firing in individual neurons or a fraction of presynaptic inputs, while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. We find that synaptic scaling is rapidly induced by block of postsynaptic firing, but not by local synaptic blockade, and is mediated through a drop in somatic calcium influx, reduced activation of CaMKIV, and an increase in transcription. Cortical neurons thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, a mechanism with the computational advantage of efficiently normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific mechanisms of information storage.},

	Abstract = {Short-term memories link events separated in time, such as past sensation and future actions. Short-term memories are correlated with selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this persistent activity we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modeling. During the delay epoch, both membrane potential and population activity of ALM neurons funneled towards discrete endpoints related to specific movement directions. These endpoints were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other endpoint, followed by incorrect actions. Our results are consistent with discrete attractor dynamics underlying short-term memory related to motor planning.},

@article{Insanally2019a,
	Abstract = {Neurons recorded in behaving animals often do not discernibly respond to sensory input and are not overtly task-modulated. These non-classically responsive neurons are difficult to interpret and are typically neglected from analysis, confounding attempts to connect neural activity to perception and behavior. Here, we describe a trial-by-trial, spike-timing-based algorithm to reveal the coding capacities of these neurons in auditory and frontal cortex of behaving rats. Classically responsive and non-classically responsive cells contained significant information about sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions. Stimulus category was more accurately represented in frontal cortex than auditory cortex, via ensembles of non-classically responsive cells coordinating the behavioral meaning of spike timings on correct but not error trials. This unbiased approach allows the contribution of all recorded neurons \textendash{} particularly those without obvious task-related, trial-averaged firing rate modulation \textendash{} to be assessed for behavioral relevance on single trials.
          , 
            Neurons encode information in the form of electrical signals called spikes. Certain neurons increase the rate at which they produce spikes under specific circumstances, e.g., whenever an animal hears a particular sound. These neurons are said to be 'classically responsive'. But not all neurons behave in this way. Others produce spikes at a variable rate that does not obviously relate to the animal's behavior. These neurons are said to be 'non-classically responsive'. They are often omitted from analyses, despite typically outnumbering their classically responsive counterparts. So, what are these neurons doing?
            To find out, Insanally et al. trained rats to respond to sounds. The animals learned to poke their nose into a window whenever they heard a specific tone, and to avoid responding whenever they heard any other tone. As the rats performed the task, Insanally et al. recorded from neurons in two areas of the brain, the frontal cortex and the auditory cortex. A computer then analyzed the activity of individual neurons during each trial.
            As expected, the firing rate of non-classically responsive cells did not relate to the animals' behavior. But the timing of this firing did. The interval between spikes contained information about which tone the animals had heard and/or how they had responded. The cells worked together in groups to encode this information. Over the course of each trial, every neuron in the group varied the interval between its spikes. Eventually, the group reached a consensus, with all neurons using the same interval to represent information relevant to the task. Groups of neurons in the frontal cortex encoded more information about the category of the tone than those in the auditory cortex.
            By including all neurons \textendash{} both classically and non-classically responsive \textendash{} this model offers a more comprehensive view of how neural activity relates to behavior. This may in turn help us understand the variable and complex neural activity seen in people with sensory and cognitive disorders.},

	Abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Even a er memorization, the training loss continues to approach zero, making the model overcon dent and the test performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, they o en fail to maintain a moderate level of training loss, ending up with a too small or too large loss. We propose a direct solution called ooding that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the ooding level. Our approach makes the loss oat around the ooding level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the ooding level. is can be implemented with one line of code, and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers. With ooding, the model will continue to ``random walk'' with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to dri into an area with a at loss landscape that leads to be er generalization. We experimentally show that ooding improves performance and as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss.},

Surprise measures how data affects an observer, in terms of differences between posterior and prior beliefs about the world. Only data observations which substantially affect the observer's beliefs yield surprise, irrespectively of how rare or informative in Shannon's sense these observations are. We test the framework by quantifying the extent to which humans may orient attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. To this end, we implement a simple computational model where a low-level, sensory form of surprise is computed by simple simulated early visual neurons. Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with 72\% of all gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a figure rising to 84\% when focusing the analysis onto regions simultaneously selected by all observers. The proposed theory of surprise is applicable across different spatiotemporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

We develop fast semi-analytic numerical methods to solve this equation for either current or conductance synapses, with and without synaptic depression. We show that its solutions match simulations of equivalent neuronal networks better than those of the Fokker-Planck equation and we compute bounds on the network response to non-instantaneous synapses. We apply these methods to study different synaptic weight distributions in feed-forward networks. We characterize the synaptic amplitude distributions using a set of measures, called tail weight numbers, designed to quantify the preponderance of very strong synapses. Even if synaptic amplitude distributions are equated for both the total current and average synaptic weight, distributions with sparse but strong synapses produce higher responses for small inputs, leading to a larger operating range. Furthermore, despite their small number, such synapses enable the network to respond faster and with more stability in the face of external fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Background: Neural oscillations are often quantified as average power relative to a cognitive, perceptual, and/or behavioral task. This is commonly done using Fourier-based techniques, such as Welch's method for estimating the power spectral density, and/or by estimating narrowband oscillatory power across trials, conditions, and/or groups. The core assumption underlying these approaches is that the mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency. Despite the importance of this assumption, it has not been rigorously tested. New method: We introduce extensions of common approaches that are better suited for the physiological reality of how neural oscillations often manifest: as nonstationary, high-power bursts, rather than sustained rhythms. Log-transforming, or taking the median power, significantly reduces erroneously inflated power estimates.
Results: Analyzing 101 participants' worth of human electrophysiology, totaling 3,560 channels and over 40 hours data, we show that, in all cases examined, spectral power is not Gaussian distributed. This is true even when oscillations are prominent and sustained, such as visual cortical alpha. Power across time, at every frequency, is characterized by a substantial long tail, which implies that estimates of average power are skewed toward large, infrequent high-power oscillatory bursts.
Comparison with existing methods: In a simulated event-related experiment we show how introducing just a few high-power oscillatory bursts, as seen in real data, can, perhaps erroneously, cause significant differences between conditions using traditional methods. These erroneous effects are substantially reduced with our new methods.
Conclusions: These results call into question the validity of common statistical practices in neural oscillation research.},

	Abstract = {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass \textendash{} amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

	Abstract = {Neural networks dominate the modern machine learning landscape, but their training and success still suffer from sensitivity to empirical choices of hyperparameters such as model architecture, loss function, and optimisation algorithm. In this work we present Population Based Training (PBT), a simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which results in stable training and better final performance.},

	Abstract = {Cortical computations are critically dependent on interactions between pyramidal neurons (PNs) and a menagerie of inhibitory interneuron types. A key feature distinguishing interneuron types is the spatial distribution of their synaptic contacts onto PNs, but the location-dependent effects of inhibition are mostly unknown, especially under conditions involving active dendritic responses. We studied the effect of somatic vs. dendritic inhibition on local spike generation in basal dendrites of layer 5 PNs both in neocortical slices and in simple and detailed compartmental models, with equivalent results: somatic inhibition divisively suppressed the amplitude of dendritic spikes recorded at the soma while minimally affecting dendritic spike thresholds. In contrast, distal dendritic inhibition raised dendritic spike thresholds while minimally affecting their amplitudes. On-the-path dendritic inhibition modulated both the gain and threshold of dendritic spikes depending on its distance from the spike initiation zone. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits could assign different mixtures of gain vs. threshold inhibition to different neural pathways, and thus tailor their local computations, by managing their relative activation of soma- vs. dendrite-targeting interneurons.},

When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based learning.},

	Abstract = {Feedforward deep neural networks (DNN), artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers, have recently demonstrated a record-breaking performance in multiple areas of applications in computer vision and speech processing. Following the success, DNNs have been applied to neuroimaging modalities including functional/structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron-emission tomography data. However, no study has explicitly applied DNNs to 3D wholebrain fMRI volumes and thereby extracted hidden volumetric representations of fMRI that are discriminative for a task performed as the fMRI volume was acquired. Our study applied fully connected feedforward DNN to fMRI volumes collected in four sensorimotor tasks (i.e., left-hand clenching, right-hand clenching, auditory attention, and visual stimulus) undertaken by 12 healthy participants. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme, a restricted Boltzmann machinebased deep belief network was pretrained and used to initialize weights of the DNN. The pretrained DNN was fine-tuned while systematically controlling weight-sparsity levels across hidden layers. Optimal weight-sparsity levels were determined from a minimum validation error rate of fMRI volume classification. Minimum error rates (mean  standard deviation; \%) of 6.9 ( 3.8) were obtained from the three-layer DNN with the sparsest condition of weights across the three hidden layers. These error rates were even lower than the error rates from the single-layer network (9.4 {$\pm$} 4.6) and the two-layer network (7.4 {$\pm$} 4.1). The estimated DNN weights showed spatial patterns that are remarkably task-specific, particularly in the higher layers. The output values of the third hidden layer represented distinct patterns/codes of the 3D whole-brain fMRI volume and encoded the information of the tasks as evaluated from representational similarity analysis. Our reported findings show the ability of the DNN to classify a single fMRI volume based on the extraction of hidden representations of fMRI volumes associated with tasks across multiple hidden layers. Our study may be beneficial to the automatic classification/diagnosis of neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases and prediction of disease severity and recovery in (pre-) clinical settings using fMRI volumes without requiring an estimation of activation patterns or ad hoc statistical evaluation.},

	Abstract = {There is a tension between the conception of cognition as a central nervous system (CNS) process and a view of cognition as extending towards the body or the contiguous environment. The centralised conception requires large or complex nervous systems to cope with complex environments. Conversely, the extended conception involves the outsourcing of information processing to the body or environment, thus making fewer demands on the processing power of the CNS. The evolution of extended cognition should be particularly favoured among small, generalist predators such as spiders, and here, we review the literature to evaluate the fit of empirical data with these contrasting models of cognition. Spiders do not seem to be cognitively limited, displaying a large diversity of learning processes, from habituation to contextual learning, including a sense of numerosity. To tease apart the central from the extended cognition, we apply the mutual manipulability criterion, testing the existence of reciprocal causal links between the putative elements of the system. We conclude that the web threads and configurations are integral parts of the cognitive systems. The extension of cognition to the web helps to explain some puzzling features of spider behaviour and seems to promote evolvability within the group, enhancing innovation through cognitive connectivity to variable habitat features.},

In particular, measures quantifying the coupling between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of fast oscillations have been applied to a wide range of data recorded from animals and humans. Some of the measures applied to detect phase-amplitude coupling have been criticized for being sensitive to nonsinusoidal properties of the oscillations and thus spuriously indicate the presence of coupling. While such instances of spurious identification of coupling have been observed, in this commentary we give concrete examples illustrating cases when the identification of cross-frequency coupling can be trusted. These examples are based on control analyses and empirical observations rather than signal-processing tools. Finally, we provide concrete advice on how to determine when measures of phase-amplitude coupling can be considered trustworthy.},

However, questions remain regarding both the empirical and conceptual relationships between results from MVPA and standard univariate analyses. In the current study, whole-brain univariate and searchlight MVPAs of parametric manipulations of monetary gain and loss in a decision making task (Tom et al., 2007) were compared to identify the differences in the results across these methods and the implications for understanding the underlying mental processes. The MVPA and univariate results did identify some overlapping regions in whole brain analyses. However, an analysis of consistency revealed that in many regions the effect size estimates obtained from MVPA and univariate analysis were uncorrelated. Moreover, comparison of sensitivity showed a general trend towards greater sensitivity to task manipulations by MVPA compared to univariate analysis. These results demonstrate that MVPA methods may provide a different view of the functional organization of mental processing compared to univariate analysis, wherein MVPA is more sensitive to distributed coding of information whereas univariate analysis is more sensitive to global engagement in ongoing tasks. The results also highlight the need for better ways to integrate these methods.},

	Abstract = {A signature feature of the neocortex is the dense network of horizontal connections (HCs) through which pyramidal neurons (PNs) exchange "contextual" information. In primary visual cortex (V1), HCs are thought to facilitate boundary detection, a crucial operation for object recognition, but how HCs modulate PN responses to boundary cues within their classical receptive fields (CRF) remains unknown. We began by ``asking'' natural images, through a structured data collection and ground truth labeling process, what function a V1 cell should use to compute boundary probability from aligned edge cues within and outside its CRF. The ``answer'' was an asymmetric 2-D sigmoidal function, whose nonlinear form provides the first normative account for the ``multiplicative'' center-flanker interactions previously reported in V1 neurons (Kapadia et al. 1995, 2000; Polat et al. 1998). Using a detailed compartmental model, we then show that this boundary-detecting classical-contextual interaction function can be computed with near perfect accuracy by NMDAR-dependent spatial synaptic interactions within PN dendrites \textendash{} the site where classical and contextual inputs first converge in the cortex. In additional simulations, we show that local interneuron circuitry activated by HCs can powerfully leverage the nonlinear spatial computing capabilities of PN dendrites, providing the cortex with a highly flexible substrate for integration of classical and contextual information.},

	Abstract = {Large scale brain networks are understood nowadays to underlie the emergence of cognitive functions, though the detailed mechanisms are hitherto unknown. The challenges in the study of large scale brain networks are amongst others their high dimensionality requiring significant computational efforts, the complex connectivity across brain areas and the associated transmission delays, as well as the stochastic nature of neuronal processes. To decrease the computational effort, neurons are clustered into neural masses, which then are approximated by reduced descriptions of population dynamics. Here, we implement a neural population mode approach (Assisi et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 94(1):018106, 2005; Stefanescu and Jirsa in PLoS Comput. Biol. 4(11):e1000219, 2008), which parsimoniously captures various types of population behavior. We numerically demonstrate that the reduced population mode system favorably captures the high-dimensional dynamics of neuron networks with an architecture involving homogeneous local connectivity and a large-scale, fiber-like connection with time delay.},

Here we take a simulated classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the processor.

	Abstract = {Much current research on speeded choice utilizes models in which the response is triggered by a stochastic process crossing a deterministic threshold. This article focuses on two such model classes, one based on continuous-time diffusion and the other on linear ballistic accumulation (LBA). Both models assume random variability in growth rates and in other model components across trials. We show that if the form of this variability is unconstrained, the models can exactly match any possible pattern of response probabilities and response time distributions. Thus, the explanatory or predictive content of these models is determined not by their structural assumptions, but rather by distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian distributions) that are traditionally regarded as implementation details. Selective influence assumptions (i.e., which experimental manipulations affect which model parameters) are shown to have no restrictive effect, except for the theoretically questionable assumption that speed-accuracy instructions do not affect growth rates. The second contribution of this article concerns translation of falsifiable models between universal modeling languages. Specifically, we translate the predictions of the diffusion and LBA models (with their parametric and selective influence assumptions intact) into the Grice modeling framework, in which accumulation processes are deterministic and thresholds are random variables. The Grice framework is also known to reproduce any possible pattern of response probabilities and times, and hence it can be used as a common language for comparing models. It is found that only a few simple properties of empirical data are necessary predictions of the diffusion and LBA models.},

	Abstract = {Rhythms are a prominent signature of brain activity. Their expression is correlated with numerous examples of healthy information processing and their fluctuations are a marker of disease states. Yet, their causal or epiphenomenal role in brain function is still highly debated. We review recent studies showing brain rhythms are not always ``rhythmic'', by which we mean representative of repeated cycles of activity. Rather, high power and continuous rhythms in averaged signals can represent brief transient events on single trials whose density accumulates in the average. We also review evidence showing time-domain signals with vastly different waveforms can exhibit identical spectral-domain frequency and power. Further, non-oscillatory waveform feature can create spurious high spectral power. Knowledge of these possibilities is essential when interpreting rhythms and is easily missed without considering pre-processed data. Lastly, we discuss how these finding suggest new directions to pursue in our quest to discover the mechanism and meaning of brain rhythms.},

Much of this progress is fueled through advances in convolutional neural network architectures and learning algorithms even as the basic premise of a convolutional layer has remained unchanged. In this paper, we seek to revisit the convolutional layer that has been the workhorse of state-of-the-art visual recognition models. We introduce a very simple, yet effective, module called a perturbation layer as an alternative to a convolutional layer. The perturbation layer does away with convolution in the traditional sense and instead computes its response as a weighted linear combination of non-linearly activated additive noise perturbed inputs. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this perturbation layer can be an effective replacement for a standard convolutional layer. Empirically, deep neural networks with perturbation layers, called Perturbative Neural Networks (PNNs), in lieu of convolutional layers perform comparably with standard CNNs on a range of visual datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, PASCAL VOC, and ImageNet) with fewer parameters.},

	Abstract = {Firing patterns in the central nervous system often exhibit strong temporal irregularity and heterogeneity in their time averaged response properties. Previous studies suggested that these properties are outcome of an intrinsic chaotic dynamics. Indeed, simplified rate-based large neuronal networks with random synaptic connections are known to exhibit sharp transition from fixed point to chaotic dynamics when the synaptic gain is increased. However, the existence of a similar transition in neuronal circuit models with more realistic architectures and firing dynamics has not been established. In this work we investigate rate based dynamics of neuronal circuits composed of several subpopulations and random connectivity. Nonzero connections are either positive-for excitatory neurons, or negative for inhibitory ones, while single neuron output is strictly positive; in line with known constraints in many biological systems. Using Dynamic Mean Field Theory, we find the phase diagram depicting the regimes of stable fixed point, unstable dynamic and chaotic rate fluctuations. We characterize the properties of systems near the chaotic transition and show that dilute excitatory-inhibitory architectures exhibit the same onset to chaos as a network with Gaussian connectivity. Interestingly, the critical properties near transition depend on the shape of the single- neuron input-output transfer function near firing threshold. Finally, we investigate network models with spiking dynamics. When synaptic time constants are slow relative to the mean inverse firing rates, the network undergoes a sharp transition from fast spiking fluctuations and static firing rates to a state with slow chaotic rate fluctuations. When the synaptic time constants are finite, the transition becomes smooth and obeys scaling properties, similar to crossover phenomena in statistical mechanics},

@article{Kahnt2011,
	Abstract = {In everyday life, successful decision making requires precise representations of expected values. However, for most behavioral options more than one attribute can be relevant in order to predict the expected reward. Thus, to make good or even optimal choices the reward predictions of multiple attributes need to be integrated into a combined expected value. Importantly, the individual attributes of such multi-attribute objects can agree or disagree in their reward prediction. Here we address where the brain encodes the combined reward prediction (averaged across attributes) and where it encodes the variability of the value predictions of the individual attributes. We acquired fMRI data while subjects performed a task in which they had to integrate reward predictions from multiple attributes into a combined value. Using time-resolved pattern recognition techniques (support vector regression) we find that (1) the combined value is encoded in distributed fMRI patterns in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and that (2) the variability of value predictions of the individual attributes is encoded in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The combined value could be used to guide choices, whereas the variability of the value predictions of individual attributes indicates an ambiguity that results in an increased difficulty of the value-integration. These results demonstrate that the different features defining multi-attribute objects are encoded in non-overlapping brain regions and therefore suggest different roles for vmPFC and dlPFC in multi-attribute decision making. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We present a single model that yields good results on a number of problems spanning multiple domains. In particular, this single model is trained concurrently on ImageNet, multiple translation tasks, image captioning (COCO dataset), a speech recognition corpus, and an English parsing task. Our model architecture incorporates building blocks from multiple domains. It contains convolutional layers, an attention mechanism, and sparsely-gated layers. Each of these computational blocks is crucial for a subset of the tasks we train on. Interestingly, even if a block is not crucial for a task, we observe that adding it never hurts performance and in most cases improves it on all tasks. We also show that tasks with less data benefit largely from joint training with other tasks, while performance on large tasks degrades only slightly if at all.},

This model is supported by a wealth of experimental data. However, in certain circumstances, the activity of the dopamine cells seems anomalous under the model, as they respond in particular ways to stimuli that are not obviously related to predictions of reward. In this paper, we address two important sets of anomalies, those having to do with generalization and novelty. Generalization responses are treated as the natural consequence of partial information; novelty responses are treated by the suggestion that dopamine cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including exploration bonuses and shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for dopamine in terms of the mechanistic attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration. q 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of selecting, from among the arms of a stochastic n-armed bandit, a subset of size m of those arms with the highest expected rewards, based on efficiently sampling the arms. This ``subset selection'' problem finds application in a variety of areas. In the authors' previous work (Kalyanakrishnan \& Stone, 2010), this problem is framed under a PAC setting (denoted ``Explore-m''), and corresponding sampling algorithms are analyzed. Whereas the formal analysis therein is restricted to the worst case sample complexity of algorithms, in this paper, we design and analyze an algorithm (``LUCB'') with improved expected sample complexity. Interestingly LUCB bears a close resemblance to the wellknown UCB algorithm for regret minimization. The expected sample complexity bound we show for LUCB is novel even for singlearm selection (Explore-1). We also give a lower bound on the worst case sample complexity of PAC algorithms for Explore-m.},

	Abstract = {Here we highlight an emerging trend in the use of machine learning classifiers to test for abstraction across patterns of neural activity. When a classifier algorithm is trained on data from one cognitive context, and tested on data from another, conclusions can be drawn about the role of a given brain region in representing information that abstracts across those cognitive contexts. We call this kind of analysis Multivariate CrossClassification (MVCC), and review several domains where it has recently made an impact. MVCC has been important in establishing correspondences among neural patterns across cognitive domains, including motor-perception matching and cross-sensory matching. It has been used to test for similarity between neural patterns evoked by perception and those generated from memory. Other work has used MVCC to investigate the similarity of representations for semantic categories across different kinds of stimulus presentation, and in the presence of different cognitive demands. We use these examples to demonstrate the power of MVCC as a tool for investigating neural abstraction and discuss some important methodological issues related to its application.},

	Abstract = {Probabilistic inference provides a language for describing how organisms may learn from and adapt to their environment. The computations needed to implement probabilistic inference often require specific representations, akin to having the suitable data structures for implementing certain algorithms in computer programming. Yet it is unclear how such representations can be instantiated in the stochastic, parallel-running biochemical machinery found in cells (such as single-celled organisms). Here, we show how representations for supporting inference in Markov models can be embodied in cellular circuits, by combining a concentration-dependent scheme for encoding probabilities with a mechanism for directional counting. We show how the logic of protein production and degradation constrains the computation we set out to implement. We argue that this process by which an abstract computation is shaped by its biochemical realization strikes a compromise between ``rationalistic'' information-processing perspectives and alternative approaches that emphasize embodiment.},

	Abstract = {In a wide range of studies, the emergence of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex has been attributed to a complex interaction between feed-forward thalamic input and inhibitory mechanisms at the level of cortex. Although it is well known that layer 4 cortical neurons are highly sensitive to the timing of thalamic inputs, the role of the stimulus-driven timing of thalamic inputs in cortical orientation selectivity is not well understood. Here we show that the synchronization of thalamic firing contributes directly to the orientation tuned responses of primary visual cortex in a way that optimizes the stimulus information per cortical spike. From the recorded responses of geniculate X-cells in the anesthetized cat, we synthesized thalamic sub-populations that would likely serve as the synaptic input to a common layer 4 cortical neuron based on anatomical constraints. We used this synchronized input as the driving input to an integrate-and-fire model of cortical responses and demonstrated that the tuning properties match closely to those measured in primary visual cortex. By modulating the overall level of synchronization at the preferred orientation, we show that efficiency of information transmission in the cortex is maximized for levels of synchronization which match those reported in thalamic recordings in response to naturalistic stimuli, a property which is relatively invariant to the orientation tuning width. These findings indicate evidence for a more prominent role of the feed-forward thalamic input in cortical feature selectivity based on thalamic synchronization.},

	Abstract = {Self-organized criticality is a hypothesis used to explain the origin of 1/f noise and other scaling behaviors. Despite being proposed nearly 30 years ago, no consensus exists as to its exact definition or mathematical mechanism(s). Recently, a model for 1/f noise was proposed based on a family of statistical distributions known as the Tweedie exponential dispersion models. These distributions are characterized by an inherent scale invariance that manifests as a variance to mean power law, called fluctuation scaling; they also serve as foci of convergence in a limit theorem on independent and identically distributed distributions. Fluctuation scaling can be modeled by self-similar stochastic processes that relate the variance to mean power law to 1/f noise through their correlation structure. A hypothesis is proposed whereby the effects of self-organized criticality are mathematically modeled by the Tweedie distributions and their convergence behavior as applied to selfsimilar stochastic processes. Sandpile model fluctuations are shown to manifest 1/f noise, fluctuation scaling, and to conform to the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution. The Tweedie models and their convergence theorem allow for a mechanistic explanation of 1/f noise and fluctuation scaling in phenomena conventionally attributed to self-organized criticality, thus providing a paradigm shift in our understanding of these phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Efficient regulation of internal homeostasis and defending it against perturbations requires adaptive behavioral strategies. However, the computational principles mediating the interaction between homeostatic and associative learning processes remain undefined. Here we use a definition of primary rewards, as outcomes fulfilling physiological needs, to build a normative theory showing how learning motivated behaviors may be modulated by internal states. Within this framework, we mathematically prove that seeking rewards is equivalent to the fundamental objective of physiological stability, defining the notion of physiological rationality of behavior. We further suggest a formal basis for temporal discounting of rewards by showing that discounting motivates animals to follow the shortest path in the space of physiological variables toward the desired setpoint. We also explain how animals learn to act predictively to preclude prospective homeostatic challenges, and several other behavioral patterns. Finally, we suggest a computational role for interaction between hypothalamus and the brain reward system.
          , 
            Our survival depends on our ability to maintain internal states, such as body temperature and blood sugar levels, within narrowly defined ranges, despite being subject to constantly changing external forces. This process, which is known as homeostasis, requires humans and other animals to carry out specific behaviors\textemdash{}such as seeking out warmth or food\textemdash{}to compensate for changes in their environment. Animals must also learn to prevent the potential impact of changes that can be anticipated.
            A network that includes different regions of the brain allows animals to perform the behaviors that are needed to maintain homeostasis. However, this network is distinct from the network that supports the learning of new behaviors in general. These two systems must, therefore, interact so that animals can learn novel strategies to support their physiological stability, but it is not clear how animals do this.
            Keramati and Gutkin have now devised a mathematical model that explains the nature of this interaction, and that can account for many behaviors seen among animals, even those that might otherwise appear irrational. There are two assumptions at the heart of the model. First, it is assumed that animals are capable of guessing the impact of the outcome of their behaviors on their internal state. Second, it is assumed that animals find a behavior rewarding if they believe that the predicted impact of its outcome will reduce the difference between a particular internal state and its ideal value. For example, a form of behavior for a human might be going to the kitchen, and an outcome might be eating chocolate.
            Based on these two assumptions, the model shows that animals stabilize their internal state around its ideal value by simply learning to perform behaviors that lead to rewarding outcomes (such as going into the kitchen and eating chocolate). Their theory also explains the physiological importance of a type of behavior known as `delay discounting'. Animals displaying this form of behavior regard a positive outcome as less rewarding the longer they have to wait for it. The model proves mathematically that delay discounting is a logical way to optimize homeostasis.
            In addition to making a number of predictions that could be tested in experiments, Keramati and Gutkin argue that their model can account for the failure of homeostasis to limit food consumption whenever foods loaded with salt, sugar or fat are freely available.},

	Abstract = {Typical antipsychotics can cause disabling side effects. Specifically, antagonism of D2R signaling by the typical antipsychotic haloperidol induces parkinsonism in humans and catalepsy in rodents. Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are major regulators of motor activity through their signaling on striatal projection neurons and interneurons. We show that D2R signaling on cholinergic interneurons contributes to an in vitro pause in firing of these otherwise tonically active neurons and to the striatal dopamine/acetylcholine balance. The selective ablation of D2R from cholinergic neurons allows discrimination between the motor-reducing and cataleptic effects of antipsychotics. The cataleptic effect of antipsychotics is triggered by blockade of D2R on cholinergic interneurons and the consequent increase of acetylcholine signaling on striatal projection neurons. These studies illuminate the critical role of D2R-mediated signaling in regulating the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons and the mechanisms of typical antipsychotic side effects.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes respond to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate with dynamic spatio-temporal changes in intracellular calcium [Ca"],. Although they share a common wave-likeappearance, the different lCaz+ji changes-an initial spike, sustained elevation, oscillatory intracellular waves, and regenerative intercellular waves-are actually separate and distinct phenomena. These separate components of the astrocytic Ca2+response appear to be generated by two different signal transduction pathways. The metabotropic response evokes an initial spatial Ca"' spike that can propagate rapidly from cell to cell and appears to involve IP,. The metabotropic response can also produce oscillatory intracellular waves of various amplitudes and frequencies that propagate within cells and are sustained only in the presence of external Ca2+.The ionotropic response, however, evokes a sustained elevation in [Ca2+Jiassociated with receptormediated Na+ and Ca2+influx, depolarization, and voltage-dependent Ca2+influx. In addition, the ionotropicresponse can lead to regenerative intercellular waves that propagate smoothly and nondecrementally from cell to cell, possibly involving Na+/Ca2+ exchange. All these astrocytic [Ca2+Iichanges tend to appear wave-like, traveling from region t o region as a transient rise in [Ca" Ii. Nevertheless, as our understanding of the cellular events that underlie these [Ca2+Iichanges grows, it becomes increasingly clear that glutamate-induced Ca2+signaling is a composite of separate and distinct phenomena, which may be distinguished not based on appearance alone, but rather on their underlying mechanisms. o 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

	Abstract = {Difficult decisions often require evaluation of samples of evidence acquired sequentially. A sensible strategy is to accumulate evidence, weighted by its reliability, until sufficient support is attained. An optimal statistical approach would accumulate evidence in units of logarithms of likelihood ratios (logLR) to a desired level. Studies of perceptual decisions suggest that the brain approximates an analogous procedure, but a direct test of accumulation, in units of logLR, to a threshold in units of cumulative logLR is lacking. We trained rhesus monkeys to make decisions based on a sequence of evanescent, visual cues assigned different logLR, hence different reliability. Firing rates of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) reflected the accumulation of logLR and reached a stereotyped level before the monkeys committed to a decision. The monkeys' choices and reaction times, including their variability, were explained by LIP activity in the context of accumulation of logLR to a threshold.},

	Abstract = {Light microscopic analysis of rat subthalamic (STH) neurons which were intracellularly labeled with horseradish peroxidase, following the acquisition of electrophysiologicaldata, revealed the following: (1)The somata of STH neurons were polygonal or oval with occasionally a few somatic spines. Uusally three or four primary dendrites arose from the soma. Dendritic trunks tapered slightly and divided into long, thin, sparsely spined branches. Dendrites of some STH neurons extended into the cerebral peduncle. (2) Reconstruction of the dendritic field was made in three different planes. In either sagittal or frontal planes, the dendritic field was usually oval and the long axis was parallel to the main axis of STH. In the horizontal plane, the dendritic field of all neurons was polygonal. (3)The axons of all the neurons analyzed originated from the soma and were traced beyond the borders of STH, thus indicating that they were projection neurons. All the parent axons bifurcated at least once. After bifurcation, one axon branch coursed dorsolaterally within the cerebral peduncle and terminated in the globus pallidus. The other branch coursed caudally or mediocaudally and arborized in the substantia nigra. Frequently, the axon branches projecting toward the globus pallidus emitted fine axon collaterals within the entopeduncular nucleus. (4)About one-half of the analyzed STH neurons had intranuclear axon collaterals. The neurons with intranuclear collaterals had a higher dendritic tipslstems ratio than neurons without intranuclear collatera l \textasciitilde{}T. his observation indicated that STH neurons could be divided into two groups according to their axonal morphology. (5)The axonal terminal arborization observed in all the target sites (i.e., globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, STH, and substantia nigra) were formed with varicose collateral branches which also gave rise to short filaments with beaded endings. Some of these projection neurons could therefore communicate with the target neurons in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, entopeduncular nucleus, as well as STH through their collateral system.},

Whereas for a single cell, measurements of the intracellular voltage are technically feasible and sufficient to characterize a useful model of its behavior, making sufficient numbers of simultaneous intracellular measurements to characterize even small networks is infeasible. This paper builds on prior work on single neurons to explore whether knowledge of the time of spiking of neurons in a network, once the nodes (neurons) have been characterized biophysically, can provide enough information to usefully constrain the functional architecture of the network: the existence of synaptic links among neurons and their strength. Using standardized voltage and synaptic gating variable waveforms associated with a spike, we demonstrate that the functional architecture of a small network of model neurons can be established.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive information seeking is critical for goal-directed behavior. Growing evidence suggests the importance of intrinsic motives such as curiosity or need for novelty, mediated through dopaminergic valuation systems, in driving information-seeking behavior. However, valuing information for its own sake can be highly suboptimal when agents need to evaluate instrumental benefit of information in a forward-looking manner. Here we show that information-seeking behavior in humans is driven by subjective value that is shaped by both instrumental and noninstrumental motives, and that this subjective value of information (SVOI) shares a common neural code with more basic reward value. Specifically, using a task where subjects could purchase information to reduce uncertainty about outcomes of a monetary lottery, we found information purchase decisions could be captured by a computational model of SVOI incorporating utility of anticipation, a form of noninstrumental motive for information seeking, in addition to instrumental benefits. Neurally, trial-by-trial variation in SVOI was correlated with activity in striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, cross-categorical decoding revealed that, within these regions, SVOI and expected utility of lotteries were represented using a common code. These findings provide support for the common currency hypothesis and shed insight on neurocognitive mechanisms underlying information-seeking behavior.},

	Abstract = {We propose a simple data augmentation technique that can be applied to standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling robust learning directly from pixels without the need for auxiliary losses or pre-training. The approach leverages input perturbations commonly used in computer vision tasks to regularize the value function. Existing model-free approaches, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [20], are not able to train deep networks effectively from image pixels.

	Abstract = {Working memory and attention are closely related constructs. Models of working memory often incorporate an attention component, and some even equate working memory and attentional control. Although some attention-related processes, including inhibitory control of response conflict and interference resolution, are strongly associated with working memory, for other aspects of attention the link is less clear. We examined the association between working-memory performance and attentional breadth, the ability to spread attention spatially. If the link between attention and working memory is broader than inhibitory and interference resolution processes, then working-memory performance might also be associated with other attentional abilities, including attentional breadth. We tested 123 participants on a variety of working-memory and attentional-breadth measures, finding a strong correlation between performances on these two types of tasks. This finding demonstrates that the link between working memory and attention extends beyond inhibitory processes.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.},

@article{Kriegeskorte2011,
	Abstract = {Pattern-information analysis has become an important new paradigm in functional imaging. Here I review and compare existing approaches with a focus on the question of what we can learn from them in terms of brain theory. The most popular and widespread method is stimulus decoding by response-pattern classification. This approach addresses the question whether activity patterns in a given region carry information about the stimulus category. Pattern classification uses generic models of the stimulus\textendash{}response relationship that do not mimic brain information processing and treats the stimulus space as categorical\textemdash{}a simplification that is often helpful, but also limiting in terms of the questions that can be addressed. We can address the question whether representations are consistent across different stimulus sets or tasks by crossdecoding, where the classifier is trained with one set of stimuli (or task) and tested with another. Beyond pattern classification, a major new direction is the integration of computational models of brain information processing into pattern-information analysis. This approach enables us to address the question to what extent competing computational models are consistent with the stimulus representations in a brain region. Two methods that test computational models are voxel receptive-field modeling and representational similarity analysis. These methods sample the stimulus (or mental-state) space more richly, estimate a separate response pattern for each stimulus, and can generalize from the stimulus sample to a stimulus population. Computational models that mimic brain information processing predict responses from stimuli. The reverse transform can be modeled to reconstruct stimuli from responses. Stimulus reconstruction is a challenging feat of engineering, but the implications of the results for brain theory are not always clear. Exploratory pattern analyses complement the confirmatory approaches mentioned so far and can reveal strong, unexpected effects that might be missed when testing only a restricted set of predefined hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. For example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [Science 293:5539 (2001) 2425\textendash{}2430]. Many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fMRI data with varying degrees of success [Nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523\textendash{}534]. In this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Gaussian na{\"\i}ve Bayes (GNB), using data collected at high field (7 Tesla) with higher resolution than usual fMRI studies. We investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. The performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. An important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.},

	Abstract = {Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'.},

Our method learns from raw video frames in a fully unsupervised manner, by transporting learnt image features between video frames using a keypoint bottleneck. The discovered keypoints track objects and object parts across long time-horizons more accurately than recent similar methods. Furthermore, consistent long-term tracking enables two notable results in control domains \textendash{} (1) using the keypoint co-ordinates and corresponding image features as inputs enables highly sample-efficient reinforcement learning; (2) learning to explore by controlling keypoint locations drastically reduces the search space, enabling deep exploration (leading to states unreachable through random action exploration) without any extrinsic rewards.},

	Abstract = {Movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) are commonly associated with slow oscillations and increased synchrony of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia. The neural mechanisms underlying this dynamic network dysfunction, however, are only poorly understood. Here, we show that the strength of inhibitory inputs from striatum to globus pallidus external (GPe) is a key parameter controlling oscillations in the basal ganglia. Specifically, the increase in striatal activity observed in PD is sufficient to unleash the oscillations in the basal ganglia. This finding allows us to propose a unified explanation for different phenomena: absence of oscillation in the healthy state of the basal ganglia, oscillations in dopamine-depleted state and quenching of oscillations under deep-brain-stimulation (DBS).

	Abstract = {Most tasks in natural language processing can be cast into question answering (QA) problems over language input. We introduce the dynamic memory network (DMN), a neural network architecture which processes input sequences and questions, forms episodic memories, and generates relevant answers. Questions trigger an iterative attention process which allows the model to condition its attention on the inputs and the result of previous iterations. These results are then reasoned over in a hierarchical recurrent sequence model to generate answers. The DMN can be trained end-to-end and obtains state-of-the-art results on several types of tasks and datasets: question answering (Facebook's bAbI dataset), text classification for sentiment analysis (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and sequence modeling for part-of-speech tagging (WSJ-PTB). The training for these different tasks relies exclusively on trained word vector representations and input-question-answer triplets.},

@article{Kushnir2017,
	Abstract = {For many neural network models that are based on perceptrons, the number of activity patterns that can be classified is limited by the number of plastic connections that each neuron receives, even when the total number of neurons is much larger. This poses the problem of how the biological brain can take advantage of its huge number of neurons given that the connectivity is extremely sparse, especially when long range connections are considered. One possible way to overcome this limitation in the case of feed-forward networks is to combine multiple perceptrons together, as in committee machines. The number of classifiable random patterns would then grow linearly with the number of perceptrons, even when each perceptron has limited connectivity. However, the problem is moved to the downstream readout neurons, which would need a number of connections that is as large as the number of perceptrons. Here we propose a different approach in which the readout is implemented by connecting multiple perceptrons in a recurrent attractor neural network. We show with analytical calculations that the number of random classifiable patterns can grow unboundedly with the number of perceptrons, even when the connectivity of each perceptron remains finite. Most importantly both the recurrent connectivity and the connectivity of a downstream readout are also finite. Our study shows that feed-forward neural classifiers with numerous long range connections connecting different layers can be replaced by networks with sparse long range connectivity and local recurrent connectivity without sacrificing the classification performance. Our strategy could be used in the future to design more general scalable network architectures with limited connectivity, which resemble more closely brain neural circuits dominated by recurrent connectivity.},

The controller module, like the reservoir of the echo state network, can be initialized randomly. All linear readout modules are trained through simple linear regression, which is the only adaptive step in the modified algorithm. The resulting architecture provides modest improvements on a variety of time series processing tasks (between 5 to 50\% in performance metric depending on the task studied). The novel architecture is guaranteed to perform at least as accurately as a conventional linear readout.

	Abstract = {We have implemented a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging system based on multivariate classification. This approach is distinctly different from spatially localized real-time implementations, since it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability for a new class of experimental designs in which real-time feedback control of the stimulus is possible\textemdash{}rather than using a fixed paradigm, experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain-state feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize its performance capabilities. We observed \$80\% classification accuracy using whole brain, block-design, motor data. Within both left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes in task condition can be much faster than signal time-to-peak rates. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this technology can complement electroencephalography-based brain computer interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual reality-based training, and enhanced conscious awareness.

The primary technique for doing this is numerical continuation, where the solution of interest satisfies a parametrised set of algebraic equations, and branches of solutions are followed as the parameter is varied. An effective way to do this is with pseudoarclength continuation. We give an introduction to pseudo-arclength continuation and then demonstrate its use in investigating the behaviour of a number of models from the field of computational neuroscience. The models we consider are high dimensional, as they result from the discretisation of neural field models\textemdash{}nonlocal differential equations used to model macroscopic pattern formation in the cortex. We consider both stationary and moving patterns in one spatial dimension, and then translating patterns in two spatial dimensions.

	Abstract = {Large networks of sparsely coupled, excitatory and inhibitory cells occur throughout the brain. For many models of these networks, a striking feature is that their dynamics are chaotic and thus, are sensitive to small perturbations. How does this chaos manifest in the neural code? Specifically, how variable are the spike patterns that such a network produces in response to an input signal? To answer this, we derive a bound for a general measure of variability\textemdash{}spike-train entropy. This leads to important insights on the variability of multi-cell spike pattern distributions in large recurrent networks of spiking neurons responding to fluctuating inputs. The analysis is based on results from random dynamical systems theory and is complemented by detailed numerical simulations. We find that the spike pattern entropy is an order of magnitude lower than what would be extrapolated from single cells. This holds despite the fact that network coupling becomes vanishingly sparse as network size grows\textemdash{}a phenomenon that depends on ``extensive chaos,'' as previously discovered for balanced networks without stimulus drive. Moreover, we show how spike pattern entropy is controlled by temporal features of the inputs. Our findings provide insight into how neural networks may encode stimuli in the presence of inherently chaotic dynamics.},

Animal studies have demonstrated the existence of three functional sub-zones but these have never been shown conclusively in humans. In this work, a data driven method with diffusion weighted imaging demonstrated that three distinct clusters exist within the human STN based on brain connectivity profiles. The STN was successfully sub-parcellated into these regions, demonstrating good correspondence with that described in the animal literature. The local connectivity of each sub-region supported the hypothesis of bilateral limbic, associative and motor regions occupying the anterior, mid and posterior portions of the nucleus respectively. This study is the first to achieve in-vivo, non-invasive anatomical parcellation of the human STN into three anatomical zones within normal diagnostic scan times, which has important future implications for deep brain stimulation surgery.},

Statistically, this is a causal inference problem. Here we show how the spiking discontinuity of neurons can be a tool to estimate the causal influence of a neuron's activity on reward. We show how it can be used to derive a novel learning rule that can operate in the presence of non-linearities and the confounding influence of other neurons.

We examined single-trial responses in LIP using statistical methods for fitting and comparing latent dynamical spike train models. We compared models with latent spike rates governed by either continuous diffusion-to-bound dynamics or discrete ``stepping'' dynamics. Roughly three-quarters of the choice-selective neurons we recorded were better described by the stepping model.

	Abstract = {Game theory provides a solution to the problem of finding a set of optimal decision-making strategies in a group. However, people seldom play such optimal strategies and adjust their strategies based on their experience. Accordingly, many theories postulate a set of variables related to the probabilities of choosing various strategies and describe how such variables are dynamically updated. In reinforcement learning, these value functions are updated based on the outcome of the player's choice, whereas belief learning allows the value functions of all available choices to be updated according to the choices of other players. We investigated the nature of learning process in monkeys playing a competitive game with ternary choices, using a rock \textendash{} paper \textendash{} scissors game. During the baseline condition in which the computer selected its targets randomly, each animal displayed biases towards some targets. When the computer exploited the pattern of animal's choice sequence but not its reward history, the animal's choice was still systematically biased by the previous choice of the computer. This bias was reduced when the computer exploited both the choice and reward histories of the animal. Compared to simple models of reinforcement learning or belief learning, these adaptive processes were better described by a model that incorporated the features of both models. These results suggest that stochastic decision-making strategies in primates during social interactions might be adjusted according to both actual and hypothetical payoffs.},

Previous evidence has suggested that the `ups' and `downs' of melodic 35 contour are categorically and automatically processed, but knowledge of the brain regions that discriminate 36 different types of contour is limited. Here, we examined melodic contour discrimination using multivariate 37 pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data. Twelve non-musicians were presented with various ascending and 38 descending melodic sequences while being scanned. Whole-brain MVPA was used to identify regions in 39 which the local pattern of activity accurately discriminated between contour categories. We identified three 40 distinct cortical loci: the right superior temporal sulcus (rSTS), the left inferior parietal lobule (lIPL), and the 41 anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results complement previous findings of melodic processing within the 42 rSTS, and extend our understanding of the way in which abstract auditory sequences are categorized by the 43 human brain.},

	Abstract = {In bandit problems, a decision-maker must choose between a set of alternatives, each of which has a fixed but unknown rate of reward, to maximize their total number of rewards over a sequence of trials. Performing well in these problems requires balancing the need to search for highly-rewarding alternatives, with the need to capitalize on those alternatives already known to be reasonably good. Consistent with this motivation, we develop a new psychological model that relies on switching between latent exploration and exploitation states. We test the model over a range of two-alternative bandit problems, against both human and optimal decision-making data, comparing it to benchmark models from the reinforcement learning literature. By making inferences about the latent states from optimal decision-making behavior, we characterize how people should switch between exploration and exploitation. By making inferences from human data, we begin to characterize how people actually do switch. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding and measuring the competing demands of exploration and exploitation in sequential decision-making.},

	Abstract = {Memory impairments and heightened prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity are hallmarks of cognitive and neurobiological human aging. While structural integrity of PFC gray matter and interregional white matter tracts are thought to impact memory processing, the balance of neurotransmitters within the PFC itself is less well understood. We used fMRI to establish wholebrain networks involved in a memory encoding task and dynamic causal models (DCMs) for fMRI to determine the causal relationships between these areas. These data revealed enhanced connectivity from PFC to medial temporal cortex that negatively correlated with recall ability. To better understand the intrinsic activity within the PFC, DCM for EEG was employed after continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the PFC to assess the effect on excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) synaptic ratios and behavior. These data revealed that the young cohort had a stable E/I ratio that was unaffected by the TMS intervention, while the aged cohort exhibited lower E/I ratios driven by a greater intrinsic inhibitory tone. TMS to the aged cohort resulted in decreased intrinsic inhibition and a decrement in memory performance. These results demonstrate increased topdown influence of PFC upon medial temporal lobe in healthy aging that is associated with decreased memory and may be due to unstable local inhibitory tone within the PFC.},

	Abstract = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress towards an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search towards dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

	Abstract = {A challenge in evolutionary computation is to create representations as evolvable as those in natural evolution. This paper hypothesizes that extinction events, i.e. mass extinctions, can significantly increase evolvability, but only when combined with a divergent search algorithm, i.e. a search driven towards diversity (instead of optimality). Extinctions amplify diversity-generation by creating unpredictable evolutionary bottlenecks. Persisting through multiple such bottlenecks is more likely for lineages that diversify across many niches, resulting in indirect selection pressure for the capacity to evolve. This hypothesis is tested through experiments in two evolutionary robotics domains. The results show that combining extinction events with divergent search increases evolvability, while combining them with convergent search offers no similar benefit. The conclusion is that extinction events may provide a simple and effective mechanism to enhance performance of divergent search algorithms.},

	Abstract = {While neuroevolution (evolving neural networks) has a successful track record across a variety of domains from reinforcement learning to artificial life, it is rarely applied to large, deep neural networks. A central reason is that while random mutation generally works in low dimensions, a random perturbation of thousands or millions of weights is likely to break existing functionality, providing no learning signal even if some individual weight changes were beneficial. This paper proposes a solution by introducing a family of safe mutation (SM) operators that aim within the mutation operator itself to find a degree of change that does not alter network behavior too much, but still facilitates exploration. Importantly, these SM operators do not require any additional interactions with the environment. The most effective SM variant capitalizes on the intriguing opportunity to scale the degree of mutation of each individual weight according to the sensitivity of the network's outputs to that weight, which requires computing the gradient of outputs with respect to the weights (instead of the gradient of error, as in conventional deep learning). This safe mutation through gradients (SM-G) operator dramatically increases the ability of a simple genetic algorithm-based neuroevolution method to find solutions in high-dimensional domains that require deep and/or recurrent neural networks (which tend to be particularly brittle to mutation), including domains that require processing raw pixels. By improving our ability to evolve deep neural networks, this new safer approach to mutation expands the scope of domains amenable to neuroevolution.},

	Abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

Generally, their excellent performance is imputed to their ability to learn realistic image priors from a large number of example images. In this paper, we show that, on the contrary, the structure of a generator network is sufficient to capture a great deal of low-level image statistics prior to any learning. In order to do so, we show that a randomly-initialized neural network can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results in standard inverse problems such as denoising, superresolution, and inpainting. Furthermore, the same prior can be used to invert deep neural representations to diagnose them, and to restore images based on flash-no flash input pairs.},

There is also evidence that behavioral and neural responses to novel or rare stimuli are dependent on one's memory of past stimuli. Thus, these responses may serve as a probe of different individuals' remembering and forgetting characteristics. Here, we utilize two lossy compression models of stimulus sequences that inherently involve forgetting, which in addition to being a necessity under many conditions, also has theoretical and behavioral advantages. One model is based on a simple stimulus counter and the other on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework.

However, the human brain mechanisms that mediate flexible decisions through learning remain largely unknown. Comparing behavioral choices of human observers with those of a pattern classifier based on multivoxel single-trial fMRI signals, we show that category learning shapes processes related to decision variables in frontal and higher occipitotemporal regions rather than signal detection or response execution in primary visual or motor areas. In particular, fMRI signals in prefrontal regions reflect the observers' behavioral choice according to the learned decision criterion only in the context of the categorization task. In contrast, higher occipitotemporal areas show learning-dependent changes in the representation of perceived categories that are sustained after training independent of the task. These findings demonstrate that learning shapes selective representations of sensory readout signals in accordance with the decision criterion to support flexible decisions.},

In this paper, we present a novel methodology based on permutation analysis and conditional mutual information for estimation of a directionality index between two neuronal populations. First, the reliability of this method is numerically assessed with a coupled mass neural model; the simulations show that this method is superior to the conditional mutual information method and the Granger causality method for identifying the coupling direction between unidirectional or bidirectional neuronal populations that are generated by the mass neuronal model. The method is also applied to investigate the coupling direction between neuronal populations in CA1 and CA3 in the rat hippocampal tetanus toxin model of focal epilepsy; the propagation direction of the seizure events could be elucidated through this coupling direction estimation method. All together, these results suggest that the permutation conditional mutual information method is a promising technique for estimating directional coupling between mutually interconnected neuronal populations.},

	Abstract = {Several factors combine to make it feasible to build computer simulations of the cerebellum and to test them in biologically realistic ways. These simulations can be used to help understand the computational contributions of various cerebellar components, including the relevance of the enormous number of neurons in the granule cell layer. In previous work we have used a simulation containing 12000 granule cells to develop new predictions and to account for various aspects of eyelid conditioning, a form of motor learning mediated by the cerebellum. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of scaling up this simulation to over one million granule cells using parallel graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. We observe that this increase in number of granule cells requires only twice the execution time of the smaller simulation on the GPU. We demonstrate that this simulation, like its smaller predecessor, can emulate certain basic features of conditioned eyelid responses, with a slight improvement in performance in one measure. We also use this simulation to examine the generality of the computation properties that we have derived from studying eyelid conditioning. We demonstrate that this scaled up simulation can learn a high level of performance in a classic machine learning task, the cart\textendash{}pole balancing task. These results suggest that this parallel GPU technology can be used to build very large-scale simulations whose connectivity ratios match those of the real cerebellum and that these simulations can be used guide future studies on cerebellar mediated tasks and on machine learning problems.},

We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration nonstochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

	Abstract = {Previous theoretical work on deep learning and neural network optimization tend to focus on avoiding saddle points and local minima. However, the practical observation is that, at least in the case of the most successful Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), practitioners can always increase the network size to fit the training data (an extreme example would be [1]). The most successful DCNNs such as VGG and ResNets are best used with a degree of ``overparametrization''. In this work, we characterize with a mix of theory and experiments, the landscape of the empirical risk of overparametrized DCNNs. We first prove in the regression framework the existence of a large number of degenerate global minimizers with zero empirical error (modulo inconsistent equations). The argument that relies on the use of Bezout theorem is rigorous when the RELUs are replaced by a polynomial nonlinearity (which empirically works as well). As described in our Theory III [2] paper, the same minimizers are degenerate and thus very likely to be found by SGD that will furthermore select with higher probability the most robust zero-minimizer. We further experimentally explored and visualized the landscape of empirical risk of a DCNN on CIFAR-10 during the entire training process and especially the global minima. Finally, based on our theoretical and experimental results, we propose an intuitive model of the landscape of DCNN's empirical loss surface, which might not be as complicated as people commonly believe.},

DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating phases of exploration and transformation.

In the transformation phases, a deep learning autoencoder learns to compress the variation between the found artifacts into a lower-dimensional space. The newly trained encoder is then used as the basis for a new distance function, transforming the criteria for the next exploration phase. In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of spaceships suitable for use in two-dimensional arcade-style computer games, a representative problem in procedural content generation in games. We also situate DeLeNoX in relation to the distinction between exploratory and transformational creativity, and in relation to Schmidhuber's theory of creativity through the drive for compression progress.},

	Abstract = {Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {$\beta$}-band oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. According to the mainstream theory, this synchrony is mediated by a dopamine deficit within the striatum creating a functional imbalance between the D1-expressing medium spiny neurons, which project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus, and D2-expressing one, which target its external segment, and ultimately leads to oscillatory activity. However, anatomical evidence gathered in rodents and primates has shown that striatal neurons are for the most part not organized into independent populations differentially targeting the two segments of the globus pallidus, nor alternatively expressing D1 or D2 receptors, thus calling for an alternative mechanism through which the lack of dopamine may cause oscillations. Here we adopt a computational approach in which we investigate a model whose parameters are fit to an extensive set of anatomical and physiological constraints from non-human primates, including axonal transmission delays gathered from eight experimental studies. Investigating the lack of dopamine in this model revealed that in the absence of segregated pathways, {$\beta$}-band oscillations emerge as a consequence of the extra-striate dopaminergic receptors reduced activity. These oscillations are caused by synchronous activity within the external globus pallidus-subthalamic nucleus loop, and their frequency are modulated by the transmission delays between these nuclei. Our model delivers a parsimonious explanation of oscillations that does not require any external driving influence from cortex, nor specific medium spiny neuron properties.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal responses of sensory cortex are highly variable, and this variability is correlated across neurons. To assess how variability reflects factors shared across a neuronal population, we analyzed the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons in visual cortex. We developed a simple model that comprises two sources of shared variability: a multiplicative gain, which uniformly scales each neuron's sensory drive, and an additive offset, which affects different neurons to different degrees. This model captured the variability of spike counts and reproduced the dependence of pairwise correlations on neuronal tuning and stimulus orientation. The relative contributions of the additive and multiplicative fluctuations could vary over time and had marked impact on population coding. These observations indicate that shared variability of neuronal populations in sensory cortex can be largely explained by two factors that modulate the whole population.},

The situation gets even worse with distributed training on mobile devices (federated learning), which suffers from higher latency, lower throughput, and intermittent poor connections. In this paper, we find 99.9\% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD are redundant, and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to greatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during this compression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction, local gradient clipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. We have applied Deep Gradient Compression to image classification, speech recognition, and language modeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, and Librispeech Corpus. On these scenarios, Deep Gradient Compression achieves a gradient compression ratio from 270\texttimes{} to 600\texttimes{} without losing accuracy, cutting the gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35MB, and for DeepSpeech from 488MB to 0.74MB. Deep gradient compression enables large-scale distributed training on inexpensive commodity 1Gbps Ethernet and facilitates distributed training on mobile.},

Due to the identity mapping inherent to ResNets, our network has alternating layers of dimension one and d. This stands in sharp contrast to fully connected networks, which are not universal approximators if their width is the input dimension d [21, 11]. Hence, our result implies an increase in representational power for narrow deep networks by the ResNet architecture.},

	Abstract = {Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These ``recurrent'' switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable.},

	Abstract = {Abnormal neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study we investigated changes in rat STN neuronal activity after 28 days following the injection of 6-OHDA in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). This drug provoked a lesion of SNc that induced a dopamine (DA) depletion assessed by changes in rotating capacity in response to apomorphine injection and by histological analysis. By means of extracellular recordings and waveshape spike sorting it was possible to analyze simultaneous spike trains and compute the crosscorrelations. Based on the analysis of the autocorrelograms we classified four types of firing patterns: regular (Poissonian-like), oscillatory (in the range 4\textendash{}12 Hz), bursty and cells characterized by a long refractoriness. The distribution of unit types in the control (n = 61) and lesioned (n = 83) groups was similar, as well as the firing rate. In 6-OHDA treated rats we observed a significant increase (from 26\% to 48\%) in the number of pairs with synchronous firing. These data suggest that the synchronous activity of STN cells, provoked by loss of DA cells in SNc, is likely to be among the most significant dysfunctions in the basal ganglia of Parkinsonian patients. We raise the hypothesis that in normal conditions, DA maintains a balance between funneling information via the hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic pathway and parallel processing through the parallel cortico-basal ganglia-subthalamic pathways, both of which are necessary for selected motor behaviors.},

Under certain conditions oscillatory behavior has been observed and it is of interest to know when this behavior is periodic. Here we consider one-dimensional delay differential equations with nonnegativity constraints as prototypes for such models. We obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of slowly oscillating periodic solutions (SOPS) of such equations when the delay/lag interval is long and the dynamics depend only on the current and delayed state. Under further assumptions, including possibly longer delay intervals and restricting the dynamics to depend only on the delayed state, we prove uniqueness and exponential stability for such solutions. To prove these results, we develop a theory for studying perturbations of these constrained SOPS. We illustrate our results with simple examples of biochemical reaction network models and an Internet rate control model.},

	Abstract = {Many practical environments contain catastrophic states that an optimal agent would visit infrequently or never. Even on toy problems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents tend to periodically revisit these states upon forgetting their existence under a new policy. We introduce intrinsic fear (IF), a learned reward shaping that guards DRL agents against periodic catastrophes. IF agents possess a fear model trained to predict the probability of imminent catastrophe. This score is then used to penalize the Qlearning objective. Our theoretical analysis bounds the reduction in average return due to learning on the perturbed objective. We also prove robustness to classi cation errors. As a bonus, IF models tend to learn faster, owing to reward shaping. Experiments demonstrate that intrinsic-fear DQNs solve otherwise pathological environments and improve on several Atari games.},

One ethologically relevant mouse behavior is locating food using odor concentration gradients. To model this behavior, we use a naturalistic open field odor-based spot-finding task, examining navigation strategies as mice search for and approach an odor source. Mice were trained to navigate to odor sources paired with food reward. We detected behavioral changes consistent with localization of the odor source when mice were 10cm away from the source. These behaviors included both orientation towards the source and increased exploration time. We found that the amplitude of "casting," lateral back and forth head movement, increased exponentially with proximity to the source. We then created concentration-dependent models to simulate mouse behavior, which provided evidence for a serial-sniffing strategy (sampling concentration, moving in space, then sampling again) and a stereo-sniffing strategy (inter-nostril comparison of concentration in a single sniff). Together, these results elucidate key components of behavioral strategies for odor-based navigation.},

	Abstract = {Neuromodulation is a ubiquitous feature of neural systems, allowing flexible, context specific control over network dynamics. Neuromodulation was first described in invertebrate motor systems and early work established a basic dichotomy for neuromodulation as having either an intrinsic origin (i.e., neurons that participate in network coding) or an extrinsic origin (i.e., neurons from independent networks). In this conceptual dichotomy, intrinsic sources of neuromodulation provide a ``memory'' by adjusting network dynamics based upon previous and ongoing activation of the network itself, while extrinsic neuromodulators provide the context of ongoing activity of other neural networks. Although this dichotomy has been thoroughly considered in motor systems, it has received far less attention in sensory systems. In this review, we discuss intrinsic and extrinsic modulation in the context of olfactory processing in invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. We begin by discussing presynaptic modulation of olfactory sensory neurons by local interneurons (LNs) as a mechanism for gain control based on ongoing network activation. We then discuss the cell-class specific effects of serotonergic centrifugal neurons on olfactory processing. Finally, we briefly discuss the integration of intrinsic and extrinsic neuromodulation (metamodulation) as an effective mechanism for exerting global control over olfactory network dynamics. The heterogeneous nature of neuromodulation is a recurring theme throughout this review as the effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic modulation are generally non-uniform.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses, but it has been difficult to determine what this variability means. Is it noise, or does it carry important information \textendash{} about, for example, the internal state of the organism? We address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces \textasciitilde{}28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets, and we show, using simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings, that a single spike produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulusindependent variations in membrane potential on the order of {$\pm$}2.2 - 4.5 mV \textendash{} variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains \textendash{} yet in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code.},

In this paper, a new criterion based on the Kullback\textendash{}Leibler distance is proposed to discriminate between rival models with non-normally distributed observations.

	Abstract = {Novelties are part of our daily lives. We constantly adopt new technologies, conceive new ideas, meet new people, and experiment with new situations. Occasionally, we as individual, in a complicated cognitive and sometimes fortuitous process, come up with something that is not only new to us, but to our entire society so that what is a personal novelty can turn into an innovation at a global level. Innovations occur throughout social, biological, and technological systems and, though we perceive them as a very natural ingredient of our human experience, little is known about the processes determining their emergence. Still the statistical occurrence of innovations shows striking regularities that represent a starting point to get a deeper insight in the whole phenomenology. This paper represents a small step in that direction, focusing on reviewing the scientific attempts to effectively model the emergence of the new and its regularities, with an emphasis on more recent contributions: from the plain Simon's model tracing back to the 1950s, to the newest model of Polya's urn with triggering of one novelty by another. What seems to be key in the successful modeling schemes proposed so far is the idea of looking at evolution as a path in a complex space, physical, conceptual, biological, and technological, whose structure and topology get continuously reshaped and expanded by the occurrence of the new. Mathematically, it is very interesting to look at the consequences of the interplay between the ``actual'' and the ``possible'' and this is the aim of this short review.},

This computational model extends the input pattern and is based on the excitatory and inhibitory learning rules inspired from neural connections in the human brain's nervous system. The resulting architecture of SNP can be trained by supervised excitatory and inhibitory online learning rules. The main features of proposed single layer perceptron are universal approximation property and low computational complexity. The method is tested on 6 UCI (University of California, Irvine) pattern recognition and classification datasets. Various comparisons with multilayer perceptron (MLP) with gradient decent backpropagation (GDBP) learning algorithm indicate the superiority of the approach in terms of higher accuracy, lower time, and spatial complexity, as well as faster training. Hence, we believe the proposed approach can be generally applicable to various problems such as in pattern recognition and classification.},

	Abstract = {Objective. Continuous application of high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) often effectively reduces motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease patients. While there is a growing need for more effective and less traumatic stimulation, the exact mechanism of DBS is still unknown. Here, we present a methodology to exploit the plasticity of GABAergic synapses inside the external globus pallidus (GPe) for the optimization of DBS. Approach. Assuming the existence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at GABAergic GPe\textendash{}GPe synapses, we simulate neural activity in a network model of the subthalamic nucleus and GPe. In particular, we test different DBS protocols in our model and quantify their influence on neural synchrony. Main results. In an exemplary set of biologically plausible model parameters, we show that STDP in the GPe has a direct influence on neural activity and especially the stability of firing patterns. STDP stabilizes both uncorrelated firing in the healthy state and correlated firing in the parkinsonian state. Alternative stimulation protocols such as coordinated reset stimulation can clearly profit from the stabilizing effect of STDP. These results are widely independent of the STDP learning rule. Significance. Once the model settings, e.g., connection architectures, have been described experimentally, our model can be adjusted and directly applied in the development of novel stimulation protocols. More efficient stimulation leads to both minimization of side effects and savings in battery power.},

A common view is that a stable and shared frequency over time is required for robust and functional synchronization. To the contrary, we found that non-stationary instantaneous frequency modulations were essential for synchronization. First, we recorded gamma rhythms in monkey visual area V1, and found that they synchronized by continuously modulating their frequency difference in a phase-dependent manner. The frequency modulation properties regulated both the phase-locking and the preferred phase-relation between gamma rhythms. Second, our experimental observations were in agreement with a biophysical model of gamma rhythms and were accurately predicted by the theory of weakly coupled oscillators revealing the underlying theoretical principles that govern gamma synchronization. Thus, synchronization through instantaneous frequency modulations represents a fundamental principle of gamma-band neural coordination that is likely generalizable to other brain rhythms.},

	Abstract = {The expressive power of neural networks is important for understanding deep learning. Most existing works consider this problem from the view of the depth of a network. In this paper, we study how width affects the expressiveness of neural networks. Classical results state that depth-bounded (e.g. depth-2) networks with suitable activation functions are universal approximators. We show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks: width-(n + 4) ReLU networks, where n is the input dimension, are universal approximators. Moreover, except for a measure zero set, all functions cannot be approximated by width-n ReLU networks, which exhibits a phase transition. Several recent works demonstrate the benefits of depth by proving the depth-efficiency of neural networks. That is, there are classes of deep networks which cannot be realized by any shallow network whose size is no more than an exponential bound. Here we pose the dual question on the width-efficiency of ReLU networks: Are there wide networks that cannot be realized by narrow networks whose size is not substantially larger? We show that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other hand, we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and shallow network with high accuracy. Our results provide more comprehensive evidence that depth may be more effective than width for the expressiveness of ReLU networks.},

@article{Lucken2013,
	Abstract = {Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormal neuronal synchronization. Desynchronization of abnormal neural synchrony is theoretically compelling because of the complex dynamical mechanisms involved. We here present a novel type of coordinated reset (CR) stimulation. CR means to deliver phase resetting stimuli at different neuronal sub-populations sequentially, i.e., at times equidistantly distributed in a stimulation cycle. This uniform timing pattern seems to be intuitive and actually applies to the neural network models used for the study of CR so far. CR resets the population to an unstable cluster state from where it passes through a desynchronized transient, eventually resynchronizing if left unperturbed. In contrast, we show that the optimal stimulation times are non-uniform. Using the model of weakly pulse-coupled neurons with phase response curves, we provide an approach that enables to determine optimal stimulation timing patterns that substantially maximize the desynchronized transient time following the application of CR stimulation. This approach includes an optimization search for clusters in a low-dimensional pulse coupled map. As a consequence, model-specific non-uniformly spaced cluster states cause considerably longer desynchronization transients. Intriguingly, such a desynchronization boost with non-uniform CR stimulation can already be achieved by only slight modifications of the uniform CR timing pattern. Our results suggest that the non-uniformness of the stimulation times can be a medically valuable parameter in the calibration procedure for CR stimulation, where the latter has successfully been used in clinical and pre-clinical studies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and tinnitus.},

To investigate the structure of these patterns, we recorded from populations of 40\textendash{}100 neurons in auditory and somatosensory cortices of anesthetized and awake rats using silicon microelectrodes. Population spike time patterns were broadly conserved across multiple sensory stimuli and spontaneous events. Although individual neurons showed timing variations between stimuli, these were not sufficient to disturb a generally conserved sequential organization observed at the population level, lasting for approximately 100 ms with spiking reliability decaying progressively after event onset. Preserved constraints were also seen in population firing rate vectors, with vectors evoked by individual stimuli occupying subspaces of a larger but still constrained space outlined by the set of spontaneous events. These results suggest that population spike patterns are drawn from a limited ``vocabulary,'' sampled widely by spontaneous events but more narrowly by sensory responses.},

	Abstract = {Attractor neural networks are thought to underlie working memory functions in the cerebral cortex. Several such models have been proposed that successfully reproduce firing properties of neurons recorded from monkeys performing working memory tasks. However, the regular temporal structure of spike trains in these models is often incompatible with experimental data. Here, we show that the in vivo observations of bistable activity with irregular firing at the single cell level can be achieved in a large-scale network model with a modular structure in terms of several connected hypercolumns. Despite high irregularity of individual spike trains, the model shows population oscillations in the beta and gamma band in ground and active states, respectively. Irregular firing typically emerges in a high-conductance regime of balanced excitation and inhibition. Population oscillations can produce such a regime, but in previous models only a non-coding ground state was oscillatory. Due to the modular structure of our network, the oscillatory and irregular firing was maintained also in the active state without fine-tuning. Our model provides a novel mechanistic view of how irregular firing emerges in cortical populations as they go from beta to gamma oscillations during memory retrieval.},

We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45\textendash{}100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-beremembered items. Beta oscillations (20\textendash{}35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/ decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.},

Scalene triangles are often rejected as instances of triangles and 798 is categorized by some as an odd number. These patterns are observed both in timed and untimed tasks, hold for people who can fully express the necessary and sufficient conditions for category membership, and for individuals with varying levels of education. A sizeable minority of people believe that 400 is more even than 798 and that an equilateral triangle is the most ``trianglest'' of triangles. Such beliefs predict how people instantiate other categories with necessary and sufficient conditions, e.g., GRANDMOTHER. I argue that the distributed and graded nature of mental representations means that human algorithms, unlike conventional computer algorithms, only approximate rule-based classification and never fully abstract from the specifics of the input. This input-sensitivity is critical to obtaining the kind of cognitive flexibility at which humans excel, but comes at the cost of generally poor abilities to perform context-free computations. If human algorithms cannot be trusted to produce unfuzzy representations of odd numbers, triangles, and grandmothers, the idea that they can be trusted to do the heavy lifting of moment-to-moment cognition that is inherent in the metaphor of mind as digital computer still common in cognitive science, needs to be seriously reconsidered.},

To provide a mechanistic explanation for how a scene can produce more or less consistent fixation maps across viewers, we created a simple computational model by assuming some high signal regions in a scene that will attract more fixations than other regions (ambient noise). We then varied the amplitude of the signal relative to noise (SNR) to examine the relationship between SNR and fixation map consistency. Our model showed that the higher a scene's SNR, the higher its fixation map consistency, suggesting that fixation map consistency reflects the SNR of a scene, an intrinsic scene property that can affect human vision and memory.},

	Abstract = {We report a similarity between the microscopic parameter dependance of emergent theories in physics and that of multiparameter models common in other areas of science. In both cases, predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in the microscopic parameters because these details are compressed into just a few governing parameters that are sufficient to describe relevant observables. We make this commonality explicit by examining parameter sensitivity in a hopping model of diffusion and a generalized Ising model of ferromagnetism. We trace the emergence of a smaller effective model to the development of a hierarchy of parameter importance quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. Strikingly, the same hierarchy appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science. We conclude that the emergence of effective continuum and universal theories in physics is due to the same parameter space hierarchy that underlies predictive modeling in other areas of science.},

	Abstract = {Much of mental life consists in thinking about object concepts that are not currently within the scope of perception. The general system that enables multiple representations to be maintained and compared is referred to as ``working memory'' [Repov{\v s} G, Baddeley A (2006) Neuroscience 139:5\textendash{}21], and involves regions in medial and lateral parietal and frontal cortex [e.g., Smith EE, Jonides J (1999) Science 283:1657\textendash{}1661]. It has been assumed that the contents of working memory index information in regions of the brain that are critical for processing and storing object knowledge. To study the processes involved in thinking about common object concepts, we used event related fMRI to study BOLD activity while participants made judgments of conceptual similarity over pairs of sequentially presented auditory words. Through a combination of conventional fMRI analysis approaches and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we show that the brain responses associated with the second word in a pair carry information about the conceptual similarity between the two members of the pair. This was the case in frontal and parietal regions involved in the working memory and decision components of the task for both analysis approaches. However, in other regions of the brain, including early visual regions, MVPA permitted classification of semantic distance relationships where conventional averaging approaches failed to show a difference. These findings suggest that diffuse and statistically sub-threshold ``scattering'' of BOLD activity in some regions may carry substantial information about the contents of mental representations. \textcopyright{} 2010 IBRO.

	Abstract = {We propose that schizophrenia involves a combination of decreased phasic dopamine responses for relevant stimuli and increased spontaneous phasic dopamine release. Using insights from computational reinforcement-learning models and basic-science studies of the dopamine system, we show that each of these two disturbances contributes to a specific symptom domain and explains a large set of experimental findings associated with that domain. Reduced phasic responses for relevant stimuli help to explain negative symptoms and provide a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with negative symptoms: reduced learning from rewards; blunted activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for rewards and positive prediction errors; blunted activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation; blunted autonomic responding for relevant stimuli; blunted neural activation for aversive outcomes and aversive prediction errors; reduced willingness to expend effort for rewards; and psychomotor slowing. Increased spontaneous phasic dopamine release helps to explain positive symptoms and provides a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with positive symptoms: aberrant learning for neutral cues (assessed with behavioral and autonomic responses), and aberrant, increased activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for neutral cues, neutral outcomes, and neutral prediction errors. Taken together, then, these two disturbances explain many findings in schizophrenia. We review evidence supporting their co-occurrence and consider their differential implications for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms.},

	Abstract = {Cortical areas differ in their patterns of connectivity, cellular composition, and functional architecture. Spike trains, on the other hand, are commonly assumed to follow similarly irregular dynamics across neocortex. We examined spike-time statistics in four parietal areas using a method that accounts for nonstationarities in firing rate. We found that, whereas neurons in visual areas fire irregularly, many cells in association and motor-like parietal regions show increasingly regular spike trains by comparison. Regularity was evident both in the shape of interspike interval distributions and in spike-count variability across trials. Thus, Poisson-like randomness is not a universal feature of neocortex. Rather, many parietal cells have reduced trial-to-trial variability in spike counts that could provide for more reliable firing-rate signals. These results suggest that spiking dynamics may play different roles in different cortical areas and should not be assumed to arise from fundamentally irreducible noise sources.},

	Abstract = {Different striatal projection neurons are the origin of a dual organization essential for basal ganglia function. We have defined an analogous division of labor in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of Parkinsonian rats, showing that the distinct temporal activities of two populations of GPe neuron in vivo are underpinned by distinct molecular profiles and axonal connectivities. A first population of prototypic GABAergic GPe neurons fire antiphase to subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons, often express parvalbumin, and target downstream basal ganglia nuclei, including STN. In contrast, a second population (arkypallidal neurons) fire in-phase with STN neurons, express preproenkephalin, and only innervate the striatum. This novel cell type provides the largest extrinsic GABAergic innervation of striatum, targeting both projection neurons and interneurons. We conclude that GPe exhibits several core components of a dichotomous organization as fundamental as that in striatum. Thus, two populations of GPe neuron together orchestrate activities across all basal ganglia nuclei in a cell-type-specific manner.},

	Abstract = {A common belief in model-free reinforcement learning is that methods based on random search in the parameter space of policies exhibit significantly worse sample complexity than those that explore the space of actions. We dispel such beliefs by introducing a random search method for training static, linear policies for continuous control problems, matching state-ofthe-art sample efficiency on the benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our method also finds a nearly optimal controller for a challenging instance of the Linear Quadratic Regulator, a classical problem in control theory, when the dynamics are not known. Computationally, our random search algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient than the fastest competing model-free methods on these benchmarks. We take advantage of this computational efficiency to evaluate the performance of our method over hundreds of random seeds and many different hyperparameter configurations for each benchmark task. Our simulations highlight a high variability in performance in these benchmark tasks, suggesting that commonly used estimations of sample efficiency do not adequately evaluate the performance of RL algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

The small number of easily identifiable neurons allowed the establishment of connectivity diagrams among the neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion. We now know that (a) neuromodulatory substances reconfigure circuit dynamics by altering synaptic strength and voltage-dependent conductances and (b) individual neurons can switch among different functional circuits. Computational and experimental studies of single-neuron and network homeostatic regulation have provided insight into compensatory mechanisms that can underlie stable network performance. Many of the observations first made using the stomatogastric nervous system can be generalized to other invertebrate and vertebrate circuits.},

	Abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons fire irregularly, with interspersed clusters of high-frequency spikes, commonly called `bursts'. In this review we examine such heterogeneity in activity, and provide insight into how it can participate in psychiatric conditions such as drug addiction. We first describe several techniques used to evaluate dopamine neuron activity, and comment on the different measures that each provides. We next describe the activity of dopamine neurons in `basal' conditions. Specifically, we discuss how the use of anesthesia and reduced preparations may alter aspects of dopamine cell activity, and how there is heterogeneity across species and regions. We also describe how dopamine cell firing changes throughout the peri-adolescent period and how dopamine neuron activity differs across the population. In the final section, we discuss how dopamine neuron activity changes in response to life events. First, we focus attention on drugs of abuse. Drugs themselves change firing activity through a variety of mechanisms, with effects on firing while drug is present differing from those seen after drug discontinuation. We then review how stimuli that are rewarding, aversive, or salient can evoke changes in firing rate and discharge pattern of dopamine neurons, and provide behavioral relevance of dopamine signaling. Finally, we discuss how stress can modulate dopamine neuron firing and how this may contribute to the role that stressful experiences play in psychiatric disorders such as addiction and depression.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a generic approach to modelling dynamics in neuronal populations. This approach models a full density on the states of neuronal populations but finesses this high-dimensional problem by reformulating density dynamics in terms of ordinary differential equations on the sufficient statistics of the densities considered (c.f., the method of moments). The particular form for the population density we adopt is a Gaussian density (c.f., the Laplace assumption). This means population dynamics are described by equations governing the evolution of the population's mean and covariance. We derive these equations from the Fokker-Planck formalism and illustrate their application to a conductance-based model of neuronal exchanges. One interesting aspect of this formulation is that we can uncouple the mean and covariance to furnish a neural-mass model, which rests only on the populations mean. This enables us to compare equivalent mean-field and neural-mass models of the same populations and evaluate, quantitatively, the contribution of population variance to the expected dynamics. The mean-field model presented here will form the basis of a dynamic causal model of observed electromagnetic signals in future work.},

@article{Marzen2015,
	Abstract = {The mutual information between stimulus and spike-train response is commonly used to monitor neural coding efficiency, but neuronal computation broadly conceived requires more refined and targeted information measures of input-output joint processes. A first step towards that larger goal is to develop information measures for individual output processes, including information generation (entropy rate), stored information (statistical complexity), predictable information (excess entropy), and active information accumulation (bound information rate). We calculate these for spike trains generated by a variety of noise-driven integrate-and-fire neurons as a function of time resolution and for alternating renewal processes. We show that their time-resolution dependence reveals coarsegrained structural properties of interspike interval statistics; e.g., {$\tau$} -entropy rates that diverge less quickly than the firing rate indicate interspike interval correlations. We also find evidence that the excess entropy and regularized statistical complexity of different types of integrate-and-fire neurons are universal in the continuous-time limit in the sense that they do not depend on mechanism details. This suggests a surprising simplicity in the spike trains generated by these model neurons. Interestingly, neurons with gamma-distributed ISIs and neurons whose spike trains are alternating renewal processes do not fall into the same universality class. These results lead to two conclusions. First, the dependence of information measures on time resolution reveals mechanistic details about spike train generation. Second, information measures can be used as model selection tools for analyzing spike train processes.},

Our objective was to define the anatomy of the STN using 9.4 T MRI of post mortem tissue with histological validation. Spin-echo (SE) and 3D gradient-echo (GE) images were obtained at 9.4 T in 8 post mortem tissue blocks and compared directly with corresponding histological slides prepared with Luxol Fast Blue/Cresyl Violet (LFB/CV) in 4 cases and Perl stain in 3. The variability of the STN anatomy was studied using internal reference points. The anatomy of the STN and surrounding structures was demonstrated in all three anatomical planes using 9.4 T MR images in concordance with LFB/CV stained histological sections. Signal hypointensity was seen in 6/8 cases in the anterior and medial STN that corresponded with regions of more intense Perl staining. There was significant variability in the volume, shape and location of the borders of the STN. Using 9.4 T MRI, the internal signal characteristics and borders of the STN are clearly defined and significant anatomical variability is apparent. Direct visualisation of the STN is possible using high field MRI and this is particularly relevant, given its anatomical variability, for planning deep brain stimulation.},

In the Umwelt or perceptual world of an octopus, what the lateralized monocular eyes perceive is not color but the plane of polarization of light. Information is processed by a bilateral brain but manipulation is done by a radially symmetrical set of eight arms. Octopuses do not self-monitor by vision. Their skin pattern system, used for excellent camouflage, is open loop. The output of the motor system of the eight arms is organized at several levels \textemdash{} brain, intrabrachial commissure and local brachial ganglia. Octopuses may be motivated by a combination of fear and exploration. Several actions \textemdash{} a head bob for motion parallax, a `Passing Cloud' skin display to startle prey, and particularly exploration by their arms \textemdash{} demonstrate the presence of a controlling mind, motivated to gather information. Yet most octopuses are solitary and many are cannibalistic, so they must always be on guard, even against conspecifics. The actions of octopuses can be domain general, with flexible problem-solving strategies, enabling them to survive ``by their wits'' in a challenging and variable environment.},

	Abstract = {Dry electrodes are becoming popular for both lab-based and consumer-level electrophysiological-recording technologies because they better afford the ability to move traditional lab-based research into the real world. It is unclear, however, how dry electrodes compare in data quality to traditional electrodes. The current study compared three EEG electrode types: (a) passive-wet electrodes with no onboard amplification, (b) actively amplified, wet electrodes with moderate impedance levels, and low impedance levels, and (c) active-dry electrodes with very high impedance. Participants completed a classic P3 auditory oddball task to elicit characteristic EEG signatures and eventrelated potentials (ERPs). Across the three electrode types, we compared single-trial noise, average ERPs, scalp topographies, ERP noise, and ERP statistical power as a function of number of trials. We extended past work showing active electrodes' insensitivity to moderate levels of interelectrode impedance when compared to passive electrodes in the same amplifier. Importantly, the new dry electrode system could reliably measure EEG spectra and ERP components comparable to traditional electrode types. As expected, however, dry active electrodes with very high interelectrode impedance exhibited marked increases in single-trial and average noise levels, which decreased statistical power, requiring more trials to detect significant effects. This power decrease must be considered as a tradeoff with the ease of application and long-term use. The current results help set constraints on experimental design with novel dry electrodes, and provide important evidence needed to measure brain activity in novel settings and situations.},

@article{Mazzoni2015,
	Abstract = {Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) network models are commonly used to study how the spiking dynamics of neural networks changes with stimuli, tasks or dynamic network states. However, neurophysiological studies in vivo often rather measure the mass activity of neuronal microcircuits with the local field potential (LFP). Given that LFPs are generated by spatially separated currents across the neuronal membrane, they cannot be computed directly from quantities defined in models of point-like LIF neurons. Here, we explore the best approximation for predicting the LFP based on standard output from point-neuron LIF networks. To search for this best ``LFP proxy'', we compared LFP predictions from candidate proxies based on LIF network output (e.g, firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents) with ``ground-truth'' LFP obtained when the LIF network synaptic input currents were injected into an analogous three-dimensional (3D) network model of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphology, spatial distributions of somata and synapses. We found that a specific fixed linear combination of the LIF synaptic currents provided an accurate LFP proxy, accounting for most of the variance of the LFP time course observed in the 3D network for all recording locations. This proxy performed well over a broad set of conditions, including substantial variations of the neuronal morphologies. Our results provide a simple formula for estimating the time course of the LFP from LIF network simulations in cases where a single pyramidal population dominates the LFP generation, and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental LFP recordings in vivo.},

@article{McIntosh2017,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in sensory neuroscience is to understand neural computations and circuit mechanisms that underlie the encoding of ethologically relevant, natural stimuli. In multilayered neural circuits, nonlinear processes such as synaptic transmission and spiking dynamics present a significant obstacle to the creation of accurate computational models of responses to natural stimuli. Here we demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture retinal responses to natural scenes nearly to within the variability of a cell's response, and are markedly more accurate than linear-nonlinear (LN) models and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Moreover, we find two additional surprising properties of CNNs: they are less susceptible to overfitting than their LN counterparts when trained on small amounts of data, and generalize better when tested on stimuli drawn from a different distribution (e.g. between natural scenes and white noise). An examination of the learned CNNs reveals several properties. First, a richer set of feature maps is necessary for predicting the responses to natural scenes compared to white noise. Second, temporally precise responses to slowly varying inputs originate from feedforward inhibition, similar to known retinal mechanisms. Third, the injection of latent noise sources in intermediate layers enables our model to capture the sub-Poisson spiking variability observed in retinal ganglion cells. Fourth, augmenting our CNNs with recurrent lateral connections enables them to capture contrast adaptation as an emergent property of accurately describing retinal responses to natural scenes. These methods can be readily generalized to other sensory modalities and stimulus ensembles. Overall, this work demonstrates that CNNs not only accurately capture sensory circuit responses to natural scenes, but also can yield information about the circuit's internal structure and function.},

Unlike methods of analysis of fMRI data that test the time course of each voxel against a hypothesized waveform, data-driven methods, such as independent component analysis and clustering, attempt to find common features within the data. This exploratory approach can be revealing when the brain activation is difficult to predict beforehand, such as with complex stimuli and internal shifts of activation that are not time-locked to an easily specified sensory or motor event. These methods can be further improved by incorporating prior knowledge regarding the temporal and spatial extent of brain activation.},

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10\textendash{}100\texttimes{} as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

	Abstract = {Excellent models have been presented in the literature which relate membrane potential to transverse membrane current and which describe the propagation of action potentials along the axon, for both myelinated and nonmyelinated fibers. There is not, however, an adequate model for nerve excitation which allows one to compute the threshold of a nerve fiber for pulses of finite duration using electrodes that are not in direct contact with the fiber. This paper considers this problem and presents a model of the electrical properties of myelinated nerve which describes the time course of events following stimulus application up to the initiation of the action potential. The time-varying current and potential at all nodes can be computed from the model, and the strength-duration curve can be determined for arbitrary electrode geometries, although only the case of a monopolar electrode is considered in this paper. It is shown that even when the stimulus is a constant-current pulse, the membrane current at the nodes varies considerably with time. The strength-duration curve calculated from the model is consistent with previously published experimental data, and the model provides a quantitative relationship between threshold and fiber diameter which shows there is less selectivity among fibers of large diameter than those of small diameter.},

	Abstract = {Interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes in the cerebral cortex hold the key to understanding predictive coding, executive control and a gamut of other brain functions. The underlying circuit mechanism, however, remains poorly understood and represents a major challenge in neuroscience. In the present work we tackled this problem using a large-scale computational model of the primate cortex constrained by new directed and weighted connectivity data. In our model, the interplay between feedforward and feedback signaling depends on the cortical laminar structure and involves complex dynamics across multiple (intra-laminar, inter-laminar, inter-areal and whole cortex) scales. The model was tested by reproducing, and shedding insights into, a wide range of neurophysiological findings about frequency-dependent interactions between visual cortical areas: feedforward pathways are associated with enhanced gamma (30-70 Hz) oscillations, whereas feedback projections selectively modulate alpha/low beta (8-15 Hz) oscillations. We found that in order for the model to account for the experimental observations, the feedback projection needs to predominantly target infragranular layers in a target area, which leads to a proposed circuit substrate for predictive coding. The model reproduces a functional hierarchy based on frequency-dependent Granger causality analysis of inter-areal signaling, as reported in recent monkey and human experiments. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of multi-scale approaches and provides a modeling platform for studies of large-scale brain circuit dynamics and functions.},

	Abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of cell-to-cell differences in the dynamics and functions of neural networks, such as in different types of neural coding or synchronization. It is still not known, however, how neural heterogeneity can affect cortical computations, or impact the dynamics of typical cortical circuits constituted of sparse excitatory and inhibitory networks. In this work, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of a typical cortical circuit with a certain level of neural heterogeneity. Our circuit includes realistic features found in real cortical populations, such as network sparseness, excitatory, and inhibitory subpopulations of neurons, and different cell-to-cell heterogeneities for each type of population in the system. We find highly differentiated roles for heterogeneity, depending on the subpopulation in which it is found. In particular, while heterogeneity among excitatory neurons non-linearly increases the mean firing rate and linearizes the f-I curves, heterogeneity among inhibitory neurons may decrease the network activity level and induces divisive gain effects in the f-I curves of the excitatory cells, providing an effective gain control mechanism to influence information flow. In addition, we compute the conditions for stability of the network activity, finding that the synchronization onset is robust to inhibitory heterogeneity, but it shifts to lower input levels for higher excitatory heterogeneity. Finally, we provide an extension of recently reported heterogeneity-induced mechanisms for signal detection under rate coding, and we explore the validity of our findings when multiple sources of heterogeneity are present. These results allow for a detailed characterization of the role of neural heterogeneity in asynchronous cortical networks.},

We have shown, in simulation, that this approach is able to identify a space of simple biophysical models that were consistent with observed spiking data (and included the model that generated the data), but have yet to demonstrate the application of the method to identify realistic currents from real spike train data. Here, we apply the particle filter to spiking data recorded from rat layer V cortical neurons, and correctly identify the dynamics of an slow, intrinsic current. The underlying intrinsic current is successfully identified in four distinct neurons, even though the cells exhibit two distinct classes of spiking activity: regular spiking and bursting.

We cast this challenge in a machine-learning approach to predict conditions from statistical brain maps across different studies. For this, we leverage multi-task learning and multi-scale dimension reduction to learn low-dimensional representations of brain images that carry cognitive information and can be robustly associated with psychological stimuli. Our multi-dataset classification model achieves the best prediction performance on several large reference datasets, compared to models without cognitive-aware low-dimension representations; it brings a substantial performance boost to the analysis of small datasets, and can be introspected to identify universal template cognitive concepts.},

	Abstract = {Neural activity during cognitive tasks exhibits complex dynamics that flexibly encode task\-relevant variables. Recurrent neural networks operating in the near\-chaotic regime, which spontaneously generate rich dynamics, have been proposed as a model of cortical computation during cognitive tasks. However, existing methods for training these networks are either biologically implausible, and/or require a continuous, real\-time error signal to guide the learning process. The lack of a biological learning method currently restricts the plausibility of recurrent networks as models of cortical computation. Here we show that a biologically plausible learning rule can train such recurrent networks, guided solely by delayed, phasic rewards at the end of each trial, for nontrivial tasks. We use this method to learn various tasks from the experimental literature, showing that this learning rule can successfully implement flexible associations, memory maintenance, nonlinear mixed selectivities, and coordination among multiple outputs. We show that the resulting networks exhibit complex dynamics previously observed in animal cortex, such as dynamic encoding and maintenance of task features, switching from stimulus\-specific to response\-specific representations, and selective integration of relevant input streams. We conclude that recurrent neural networks offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics during both learning and performance of flexible behavior.},

	Abstract = {The impressive lifelong learning in animal brains is primarily enabled by plastic changes in synaptic connectivity. Importantly, these changes are not passive, but are actively controlled by neuromodulation, which is itself under the control of the brain. The resulting self-modifying abilities of the brain play an important role in learning and adaptation, and are a major basis for biological reinforcement learning. Here we show for the first time that artificial neural networks with such neuromodulated plasticity can be trained with gradient descent. Extending previous work on differentiable Hebbian plasticity, we propose a differentiable formulation for the neuromodulation of plasticity. We show that neuromodulated plasticity improves the performance of neural networks on both reinforcement learning and supervised learning tasks. In one task, neuromodulated plastic LSTMs with millions of parameters outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (controlling for the number of parameters). We conclude that differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks.},

	Abstract = {Deciphering how the brain generates cognitive function from patterns of electrical signals is one of the ultimate challenges in neuroscience. To this end, it would be highly desirable to monitor the activities of very large numbers of neurons while an animal engages in complex behaviors. Optical imaging of electrical activity using genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) has the potential to meet this challenge. Currently prevalent GEVIs are based on the voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein (VSFP) prototypical design or on the voltage-dependent state transitions of microbial opsins.We recently introduced a newVSFP design in which the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is sandwiched between a fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair of fluorescent proteins (termed VSFP-Butterflies) and also demonstrated a series of chimeric VSD in which portions of the VSD of Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensitive phosphatase are substituted by homologous portions of a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit.These chimeric VSD had faster sensing kinetics than that of the native Ci-VSD. Here, we describe a new set of VSFPs that combine chimeric VSD with the Butterfly structure. We show that these chimeric VSFP-Butterflies can report membrane voltage oscillations of up to 200 Hz in cultured cells and report sensory evoked cortical population responses in living mice. This class of GEVIs may be suitable for imaging of brain rhythms in behaving mammalians.},

@article{Mishra2006,
	Abstract = {Neurons in area V 2 and V 4 exhibit stimulus specific tuning to single stimuli, and respond at intermediate firing rates when presented with two differentially preferred stimuli (`pair response'). Selective attention to one of the two stimuli causes the neuron's firing rate to shift from the intermediate pair response towards the response to the attended stimulus as if it were presented alone. Attention to single stimuli reduces the response threshold of the neuron and increases spike synchronization at gamma frequencies. The intrinsic and network mechanisms underlying these phenomena were investigated in a multi-compartmental biophysical model of a reconstructed cat V 4 neuron. Differential stimulus preference was generated through a greater ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses projecting from one of two input V 2 populations. Feedforward inhibition and synaptic depression dynamics were critical to generating the intermediate pair response. Neuronal gain effects were simulated using gamma frequency range correlations in the feedforward excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the V 4 neuron. For single preferred stimulus presentations, correlations within the inhibitory population out of phase with correlations within the excitatory input significantly reduced the response threshold of the V 4 neuron. The pair response to simultaneously active preferred and non-preferred V 2 populations could also undergo an increase or decrease in gain via the same mechanism, where correlations in feedforward inhibition are out of phase with gamma band correlations within the excitatory input corresponding to the attended stimulus. The results of this model predict that top-down attention may bias the V 4 neuron's response using an inhibitory correlation phase shift mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of the dynamic and steady-state properties of biochemical networks hinge on information about the parameters of enzyme kinetics. The lack of experimental data characterizing enzyme activities and kinetics along with the associated uncertainties impede the development of kinetic models, and researchers commonly use Monte Carlo sampling to explore the parameter space. However, the sampling of parameter spaces is a computationally expensive task for larger biochemical networks. To address this issue, we exploit the fact that reaction rates of biochemical reactions and network responses can be expressed as a function of displacements from thermodynamic equilibrium of elementary reaction steps and concentrations of free enzymes and their intermediary complexes. For a set of kinetic mechanisms ubiquitously found in biochemistry, we express kinetic responses of enzymes to changes in network metabolite concentrations through these quantities both analytically and schematically. The tailor-made sampling of these quantities allows for characterizing the missing kinetic parameters and accelerating the efforts towards building genome-scale kinetic metabolic models.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful new instrument to collect vast quantities of data about activity in the human brain. A typical fMRI experiment can produce a three-dimensional image related to the human subject's brain activity every half second, at a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. As in other modern empirical sciences, this new instrumentation has led to a flood of new data, and a corresponding need for new data analysis methods. We describe recent research applying machine learning methods to the problem of classifying the cognitive state of a human subject based on fRMI data observed over a single time interval. In particular, we present case studies in which we have successfully trained classifiers to distinguish cognitive states such as (1) whether the human subject is looking at a picture or a sentence, (2) whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or non-ambiguous sentence, and (3) whether the word the subject is viewing is a word describing food, people, buildings, etc. This learning problem provides an interesting case study of classifier learning from extremely high dimensional (105 features), extremely sparse (tens of training examples), noisy data. This paper summarizes the results obtained in these three case studies, as well as lessons learned about how to successfully apply machine learning methods to train classifiers in such settings.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal mechanisms underlying beta/gamma oscillations (20\textendash{}80 Hz) are not completely understood. Here, we show that in vivo beta/gamma oscillations in the cat visual cortex sometimes exhibit remarkably stable frequency even when inputs fluctuate dramatically. Enhanced frequency stability is associated with stronger oscillations measured in individual units and larger power in the local field potential. Simulations of neuronal circuitry demonstrate that membrane properties of inhibitory interneurons strongly determine the characteristics of emergent oscillations. Exploration of networks containing either integrator or resonator inhibitory interneurons revealed that: (i) Resonance, as opposed to integration, promotes robust oscillations with large power and stable frequency via a mechanism called RING (Resonance INduced Gamma); resonance favors synchronization by reducing phase delays between interneurons and imposes bounds on oscillation cycle duration; (ii) Stability of frequency and robustness of the oscillation also depend on the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory volleys within the oscillation cycle; (iii) RING can reproduce characteristics of both Pyramidal INterneuron Gamma (PING) and INterneuron Gamma (ING), transcending such classifications; (iv) In RING, robust gamma oscillations are promoted by slow but are impaired by fast inputs. Results suggest that interneuronal membrane resonance can be an important ingredient for generation of robust gamma oscillations having stable frequency.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of the subthalamo-pallidal complex in Parkinson's disease during deep brain stimulation (DBS) were studied using two models, a simple firing-rate model and a population-based model. We extended the simple firing-rate model of the complex formed by the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external segment of the Globus Pallidus (GPe) to explore its dynamical regime during DBS. More specifically, the modulation of neuronal activity (i.e., pattern and amplitude) during DBS was studied. A similar approach was used with the population-based model. Simulation results revealed a gradual decrease in bursting activity in STN cells when the DBS frequency increased. In addition, the contribution of the stimulation current type (mono- or biphasic) to the results was also examined. A comparison of the two models indicated that the population-based model was more biologically realistic and more appropriate for exploring DBS mechanisms. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of DBS is a prerequisite for developing new stimulation protocols.},

	Abstract = {The success of lottery ticket initializations [7] suggests that small, sparsified networks can be trained so long as the network is initialized appropriately. Unfortunately, finding these ``winning ticket'' initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers. However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear. Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller datasets. We also found that winning ticket initializations generalize across optimizers with high performance. These results suggest that winning ticket initializations generated by sufficiently large datasets contain inductive biases generic to neural networks more broadly which improve training across many settings and provide hope for the development of better initialization methods.},

	Abstract = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca"+ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca"+ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.},

	Abstract = {Variation in behavior among group members often impacts collective outcomes. Individuals may vary both in the task that they perform and in the persistence with which they perform each task. Although both the distribution of individuals among tasks and differences among individuals in behavioral persistence can each impact collective behavior, we do not know if and how they jointly affect collective outcomes. Here we use a detailed computational model to examine the joint impact of colony-level distribution among tasks and behavioral persistence of individuals, specifically their fidelity to particular resource sites, on the collective tradeoff between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar ones. We developed an agent-based model of foraging honey bees, parameterized by data from 5 colonies, in which we simulated scouts, who search the environment for new resources, and individuals who are recruited by the scouts to the newly found resources, i.e., recruits. We varied the persistence to return to a particular food source of both scouts and recruits and found that for each value of persistence there is a different optimal ratio of scouts to recruits that maximizes resource collection by the colony. Furthermore, changes to the persistence of scouts induced opposite effects from changes to the persistence of recruits on the collective foraging of the colony. The proportion of scouts that resulted in the most resources collected by the colony decreased as the persistence of recruits increased. However, this optimal proportion of scouts increased as the persistence of scouts increased. Thus, behavioral persistence and task participation can interact to impact a colony's collective behavior in orthogonal directions. Our work provides new insights and generates new hypotheses into how variation in behavior at both the individual and colony levels jointly impact the trade-off between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar ones.},

We show that a model of Gamma-band rhythmic inhibition allows networks of coupled cortical circuit motifs to search for network configurations that best reconcile external inputs with an internal consistency model encoded in the network connectivity. We show that Hebbian plasticity allows the networks to learn the consistency model by example. The search dynamics driven by rhythmic inhibition enable the described networks to solve di cult constraint satisfaction problems without making assumptions about the form of stochastic fluctuations in the network. We show that the search dynamics are well approximated by a stochastic sampling process. We use the described networks to reproduce perceptual multi-stability phenomena with switching times that are a good match to experimental data and show that they provide a general neural framework which can be used to model other 'perceptual inference' phenomena.},

The main idea is to maximize the novelty of behaviors instead of the efficiency. However, abandoning the efficiency objective(s) may be too radical in many contexts. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is employed to reconcile novelty search with objective-based optimization by following a multiobjectivization process. Several multiobjectivizations based on behavioral novelty and on behavioral diversity are compared on a maze navigation task. Results show that the multiobjectivizations is better at fine-tuning behaviors than basic novelty search while keeping a comparable number of iterations to converge.},

	Abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

	Abstract = {A prerequisite for a pattern analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is estimating the patterns from time series data, which then are input into the pattern analysis. Here we focus on how the combination of study design (order and spacing of trials) with pattern estimator impacts the Type I error rate of the subsequent pattern analysis. When Type I errors are inflated, the results are no longer valid, so this work serves as a guide for designing and analyzing MVPA studies with controlled false positive rates. The MVPA strategies examined are pattern classification and similarity, utilizing single trial activation patterns from the same functional run. Primarily focusing on the Least Squares Single and Least Square All pattern estimators, we show that collinearities in the models, along with temporal autocorrelation, can cause false positive correlations between activation pattern estimates that adversely impact the false positive rates of pattern similarity and classification analyses. It may seem intuitive that increasing the interstimulus interval (ISI) would alleviate this issue, but remaining weak correlations between activation patterns persist and have a strong influence in pattern similarity analyses. Pattern similarity analyses using only activation patterns estimated from the same functional run of data are susceptible to inflated false positives unless trials are randomly ordered, with a different randomization for each subject. In other cases, where there is any structure to trial order, valid pattern similarity analysis results can only be obtained if similarity computations are restricted to pairs of activation patterns from independent runs. Likewise, for pattern classification, false positives are minimized when the testing and training sets in cross validation do not contain patterns estimated from the same run.},

However, there are not specific digital rabbit brain atlases that allow an automatic identification of brain regions, which is a crucial step for various neuroimage analyses, and, instead, manual delineation of areas of interest must be performed in order to evaluate a specific structure.

Ten individual atlases, as well as an average template and probabilistic maps of the anatomical regions were built.

	Abstract = {To understand how the brain perceives the external world, it is desirable to observe neuronal activity in the brain in real time during perception. The zebrafish is a suitable model animal for fluorescence imaging studies to visualize neuronal activity because its body is transparent through the embryonic and larval stages. Imaging studies have been carried out to monitor neuronal activity in the larval spinal cord and brain using Ca2+ indicator dyes [1\textendash{}3] and DNA-encoded Ca2+ indicators, such as Cameleon [4], GFPaequorin [5], and GCaMPs [6\textendash{}12]. However, temporal and spatial resolution and sensitivity of these tools are still limited, and imaging of brain activity during perception of a natural object has not yet been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate visualization of neuronal activity in the optic tectum of larval zebrafish by genetically expressing the new version of GCaMP. First, we demonstrate Ca2+ transients in the tectum evoked by a moving spot on a display and identify direction-selective neurons. Second, we show tectal activity during perception of a natural object, a swimming paramecium, revealing a functional visuotopic map. Finally, we image the tectal responses of a free-swimming larval fish to a paramecium and thereby correlate neuronal activity in the brain with prey capture behavior.},

@article{Muyesser,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have allowed artificial agents to rival human-level performance on a wide range of complex tasks; however, the ability of these networks to learn generalizable strategies remains a pressing challenge. This critical limitation is due in part to two factors: the opaque information representation in deep neural networks and the complexity of the task environments in which they are typically deployed. Here we propose a novel Hierarchical Q-Network (HQN), motivated by theories of the hierarchical organization of the human prefrontal cortex, that attempts to identify lower dimensional patterns in the value landscape that can be exploited to construct an internal model of rules in simple environments. We draw on combinatorial games, where there exists a single optimal strategy for winning that generalizes across other features of the game, to probe the strategy generalization of the HQN and other reinforcement learning (RL) agents using variations of Wythoff's game. Traditional RL approaches failed to reach satisfactory performance on variants of Wythoff's Game; however, the HQN learned heuristic-like strategies that generalized across changes in board configuration. More importantly, the HQN allowed for transparent inspection of the agent's internal model of the game following training. Our results show how a biologically inspired hierarchical learner can facilitate learning abstract rules to promote robust and flexible action policies in simplified training environments with clearly delineated optimal strategies.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of cross-sectional data from the normative sample of the Wechsler Memory Scale \textendash{} Third Edition (WMS-III) revealed different patterns of age-related differences in memory span measures depending on the type of memory item, processing demands, and the age of the older adult group. Regression of memory span on age revealed that the slope for Spatial Span raw scores was significantly more negative than the slope for Digit Span raw scores. There was no significant difference, however, either between the slopes for forward and backward Digit Span or between the slopes for forward and backward Spatial Span. Regression of Letter-Number Sequencing raw scores on age showed a distinctive, curvilinear pattern. Taken together, the present findings suggest that at least two mechanisms are involved in age-related differences in memory span. One mechanism, associated with a relatively linear decrease in memory span as a function of age, may differentially affect the storage of different types of information (e.g., sequences of digits vs. spatial locations). The other mechanism, evidenced by the curvilinear trend in Letter-Number Sequencing scores, may be tentatively attributed to a decline in executive aspects of working memory that becomes increasingly pronounced with age.},

	Abstract = {Humans and animals can learn complex predictive models that allow them to accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear classification, a simple technique for decoding information about experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based encoding model, which describes the information about the stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations: encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in practice these two operations are often confused, and their respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear. Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate some of the most common questions about how information is represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding model can in principle provide a complete functional description of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.},

Also, we report that the deterministic model is capable of producing irregular spiking when stimulated with constant current, indicating low-dimensional chaos.

	Abstract = {Detailed descriptions of brain-scale sensorimotor circuits underlying vertebrate behavior remain elusive. Recent advances in zebrafish neuroscience offer new opportunities to dissect such circuits via whole-brain imaging, behavioral analysis, functional perturbations, and network modeling. Here, we harness these tools to generate a brain-scale circuit model of the optomotor response, an orienting behavior evoked by visual motion. We show that such motion is processed by diverse neural response types distributed across multiple brain regions. To transform sensory input into action, these regions sequentially integrate eye- and direction-specific sensory streams, refine representations via interhemispheric inhibition, and demix locomotor instructions to independently drive turning and forward swimming. While experiments revealed many neural response types throughout the brain, modeling identified the dimensions of functional connectivity most critical for the behavior. We thus reveal how distributed neurons collaborate to generate behavior and illustrate a paradigm for distilling functional circuit models from whole-brain data.},

	Abstract = {The efferent projections of the subthalamic nucleus were studied with the autoradiographic tracing technique in Rhesus monkey and cat. From the data i t appears that the major efferent projections of the nucleus are to the pallidal complex and the substantia nigra. In both monkey and cat, the projection to the pallidal complex is truly massive and is directed a t both pallidal segments. The projection field includes an infracommissural part of the pallidal complex bordering on the substantia innominata. In the monkey the termination in the pallidal complex is organized in several characteristic bands oriented parallel to the medullary laminae. The subthalamo-pallidal projection in monkey further appears to be topographically organized. The projections to the substantia nigra is prominent in both cat and monkey though not as massive as that to the pallidal complex. The distribution of termination in the substantia nigra favors the more ventral strata near the cerebral peduncle. In the monkey the terminal distribution appears to avoid regions of the substantia nigra containing pigmented neurons and it is suggested that the subthalamonigral pathway may prefer non-dopaminergic neurons. In addition to the above major projections, sparse projections were noted to the thalamic nuclei ventralis lateralis and ventralis anterior, to the putamen, and to the mesencephalic nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus, pars compacta. The findings are discussed.},

Like conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks are particularly efficient when trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training requires overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical nature. This tutorial elucidates step-by-step the problems typically encountered when training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and datadriven learning in the spiking setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and provides an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned challenges.},

Recent studies of the larval zebrafish tectum have begun to clarify how the `microcircuitry' of this highly organized midbrain structure filters visual input, which arrives in the superficial layers and directs motor output through efferent projections from its deep layers. The new emphasis has been on the specific function of neuronal cell types, which can now be reproducibly labeled, imaged and manipulated using genetic and optical techniques. Here, we discuss recent advances and emerging experimental approaches for studying tectal circuits as models for visual processing and sensorimotor transformation by the vertebrate brain.},

Ih contributes to neuronal membrane resonance and resting membrane potential, and is modulated by second messengers. We investigated Ih oscillatory control using a multiscale computer model of hippocampal CA3, where each cell class (pyramidal, basket, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells), contained type-appropriate isoforms of Ih. Our model demonstrated that modulation of pyramidal and basket Ih allows tuning theta and gamma oscillation frequency and amplitude. Pyramidal Ih also controlled cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and allowed shifting gamma generation towards particular phases of the theta cycle, effected via Ih 's ability to set pyramidal excitability. Our model predicts that in vivo neuromodulatory control of Ih allows flexibly controlling CFC and the timing of gamma discharges at particular theta phases.},

	Abstract = {Requiring only minimal assumptions for validity, nonparametric permutation testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging experiments, at some computational expense. Introduced into the functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7\textendash{}22), the permutation approach readily accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation approach gives results similar to those obtained from a comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees of freedom, such as single subject PET/SPECT experiments or multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible explication of the method, and no freely distributed software implementing it. Consequently, there have been few practical applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical considerations are given throughout, and relevant statistical concepts are expounded in appendices. Hum. Brain Mapping 15:1\textendash{}25, 2001. \textcopyright{} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {It has become customary to conceptualize the living cell as an intricate piece of machinery, different to a man-made machine only in terms of its superior complexity. This familiar understanding grounds the conviction that a cell's organization can be explained reductionistically, as well as the idea that its molecular pathways can be construed as deterministic circuits. The machine conception of the cell owes a great deal of its success to the methods traditionally used in molecular biology. However, the recent introduction of novel experimental techniques capable of tracking individual molecules within cells in real time is leading to the rapid accumulation of data that are inconsistent with an engineering view of the cell. This paper examines four major domains of current research in which the challenges to the machine conception of the cell are particularly pronounced: cellular architecture, protein complexes, intracellular transport, and cellular behaviour. It argues that a new theoretical understanding of the cell is emerging from the study of these phenomena which emphasizes the dynamic, self-organizing nature of its constitution, the fluidity and plasticity of its components, and the stochasticity and non-linearity of its underlying processes.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative modeling of human brain activity can provide crucial insights about cortical representations [1, 2] and can form the basis for brain decoding devices [3\textendash{}5]. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have modeled brain activity elicited by static visual patterns and have reconstructed these patterns from brain activity [6\textendash{}8]. However, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured via fMRI are very slow [9], so it has been difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic stimuli such as natural movies. Here we present a new motion-energy [10, 11] encoding model that largely overcomes this limitation. The model describes fast visual information and slow hemodynamics by separate components. We recorded BOLD signals in occipitotemporal visual cortex of human subjects who watched natural movies and fit the model separately to individual voxels. Visualization of the fit models reveals how early visual areas represent the information in movies. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we also constructed a Bayesian decoder [8] by combining estimated encoding models with a sampled natural movie prior. The decoder provides remarkable reconstructions of the viewed movies. These results demonstrate that dynamic brain activity measured under naturalistic conditions can be decoded using current fMRI technology.},

Several researchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called Hogwild! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then Hogwild! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that Hogwild! outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning models have long promised to unify computational, psychological and neural accounts of appetitively conditioned behavior. However, the bulk of data on animal conditioning comes from free-operant experiments measuring how fast animals will work for reinforcement. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) models are silent about these tasks, because they lack any notion of vigor. They thus fail to address the simple observation that hungrier animals will work harder for food, as well as stranger facts such as their sometimes greater productivity even when working for irrelevant outcomes such as water. Here, we develop an RL framework for free-operant behavior, suggesting that subjects choose how vigorously to perform selected actions by optimally balancing the costs and benefits of quick responding. Motivational states such as hunger shift these factors, skewing the tradeoff. This accounts normatively for the effects of motivation on response rates, as well as many other classic findings. Finally, we suggest that tonic levels of dopamine may be involved in the computation linking motivational state to optimal responding, thereby explaining the complex vigor-related effects of pharmacological manipulation of dopamine.},

	Abstract = {Typical responses of cortical neurons to identical sensory stimuli are highly variable. It has thus been proposed that the cortex primarily uses a rate code. However, other studies have argued for spike-time coding under certain conditions. The potential role of spike-time coding is constrained by the intrinsic variability of cortical circuits, which remains largely unexplored. Here, we quantified this intrinsic variability using a biophysical model of rat neocortical microcircuitry with biologically realistic noise sources. We found that stochastic neurotransmitter release is a critical component of this variability, which, amplified by recurrent connectivity, causes rapid chaotic divergence with a time constant on the order of 10-20 milliseconds. Surprisingly, weak thalamocortical stimuli can transiently overcome the chaos, and induce reliable spike times with millisecond precision. We show that this effect relies on recurrent cortical connectivity, and is not a simple effect of feed-forward thalamocortical input. We conclude that recurrent cortical architecture supports millisecond spike-time reliability amid noise and chaotic network dynamics, resolving a long-standing debate.},

@article{Norton2003,
	Abstract = {Background: The stimulation of nerve or cortical tissue by magnetic induction is a relatively new tool for the non-invasive study of the brain and nervous system. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for example, has been used for the functional mapping of the motor cortex and may have potential for treating a variety of brain disorders.
Methods and Results: A new method of stimulating active tissue is proposed by propagating ultrasound in the presence of a magnetic field. Since tissue is conductive, particle motion created by an ultrasonic wave will induce an electric current density generated by Lorentz forces. An analytical derivation is given for the electric field distribution induced by a collimated ultrasonic beam. An example shows that peak electric fields of up to 8 V/m appear to be achievable at the upper range of diagnostic intensities. This field strength is about an order of magnitude lower than fields typically associated with TMS; however, the electric field gradients induced by ultrasound can be quite high (about 60 kV/m2 at 4 MHz), which theoretically play a more important role in activation than the field magnitude. The latter value is comparable to TMS-induced gradients.
Conclusion: The proposed method could be used to locally stimulate active tissue by inducing an electric field in regions where the ultrasound is focused. Potential advantages of this method compared to TMS is that stimulation of cortical tissue could be highly localized as well as achieved at greater depths in the brain than is currently possible with TMS.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from poor performance on important subsets of a population that are not identified during training or testing. For example, overall performance of a cancer detection model may be high, but the model still consistently misses a rare but aggressive cancer subtype. We refer to this problem as hidden stratification, and observe that it results from incompletely describing the meaningful variation in a dataset. While hidden stratification can substantially reduce the clinical efficacy of machine learning models, its effects remain difficult to measure. In this work, we assess the utility of several possible techniques for measuring and describing hidden stratification effects, and characterize these effects both on multiple medical imaging datasets and via synthetic experiments on the well-characterised CIFAR-100 benchmark dataset. We find evidence that hidden stratification can occur in unidentified imaging subsets with low prevalence, low label quality, subtle distinguishing features, or spurious correlates, and that it can result in relative performance differences of over 20\% on clinically important subsets. Finally, we explore the clinical implications of our findings, and suggest that evaluation of hidden stratification should be a critical component of any machine learning deployment in medical imaging.},

	Abstract = {Recent experimental advances are producing an avalanche of data on both neural connectivity and neural activity. To take full advantage of these two emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This problem of structure-driven activity has drawn major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks' spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how single-neuron nonlinearities\textemdash{}including those of different cell types\textemdash{}combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.},

	Abstract = {We introduce an algorithm to do backpropagation on a spiking network. Our network is "spiking" in the sense that our neurons accumulate their activation into a potential over time, and only send out a signal (a ``spike'') when this potential crosses a threshold and the neuron is reset. Neurons only update their states when receiving signals from other neurons. Total computation of the network thus scales with the number of spikes caused by an input rather than network size. We show that the spiking Multi-Layer Perceptron behaves identically, during both prediction and training, to a conventional deep network of rectified-linear units, in the limiting case where we run the spiking network for a long time. We apply this architecture to a conventional classification problem (MNIST) and achieve performance very close to that of a conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron with the same architecture. Our network is a natural architecture for learning based on streaming event-based data, and is a stepping stone towards using spiking neural networks to learn efficiently on streaming data.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the neural representation of observed actions in the human parietal and premotor cortex, which comprise the action observation network or the mirror neuron system for action recognition. Participants observed object-directed hand actions, in which action as well as other properties were independently manipulated: action (grasp or touch), object (cup or bottle), perspective (1st or 3rd person), hand (right or left), and image size (large or small). We then used multi-voxel pattern analysis to determine whether each feature could be correctly decoded from regional activities. The early visual area showed significant above-chance classification accuracy, particularly high in perspective, hand, and size, consistent with pixel-wise dissimilarity of stimuli. In contrast, the highest decoding accuracy for action was observed in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). Moreover, the decoder for action could be correctly generalized for images with high dissimilarity in the parietal and premotor region, but not in the visual area. Our study indicates that the parietal and premotor regions encode observed actions independent of retinal variations, which may subserve our capacity for invariant action recognition of others. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {How do neurons develop, control, and maintain their electrical signaling properties in spite of ongoing protein turnover and perturbations to activity? From generic assumptions about the molecular biology underlying channel expression, we derive a simple model and show how it encodes an ``activity set point'' in single neurons. The model generates diverse self-regulating cell types and relates correlations in conductance expression observed in vivo to underlying channel expression rates. Synaptic as well as intrinsic conductances can be regulated to make a self-assembling central pattern generator network; thus, network-level homeostasis can emerge from cell-autonomous regulation rules. Finally, we demonstrate that the outcome of homeostatic regulation depends on the complement of ion channels expressed in cells: in some cases, loss of specific ion channels can be compensated; in others, the homeostatic mechanism itself causes pathological loss of function.},

	Abstract = {Phase amplitude coupling' (PAC) in oscillatory neural activity describes a phenomenon whereby the amplitude of higher frequency activity is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Such coupled oscillatory activity \textendash{} also referred to as `cross-frequency coupling' or `nested rhythms' \textendash{} has been shown to occur in a number of brain regions and at behaviorally relevant time points during cognitive tasks; this suggests functional relevance, but the circuit mechanisms of PAC generation remain unclear. In this paper we present a model of a canonical circuit for generating PAC activity, showing how interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neural populations can be periodically shifted in to and out of oscillatory firing patterns by afferent drive, hence generating higher frequency oscillations phase-locked to a lower frequency, oscillating input signal. Since many brain regions contain mutually connected excitatory-inhibitory populations receiving oscillatory input, the simplicity of the mechanism generating PAC in such networks may explain the ubiquity of PAC across diverse neural systems and behaviors. Analytic treatment of this circuit as a nonlinear dynamical system demonstrates how connection strengths and inputs to the populations can be varied in order to change the extent and nature of PAC activity, importantly which phase of the lower frequency rhythm the higher frequency activity is locked to. Consequently, this model can inform attempts to associate distinct types of PAC with different network topologies and physiologies in real data.},

	Abstract = {Various arguments have been proposed for or against sub-voxel sensitivity or hyperacuity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at standard resolution. Sub-voxel sensitivity might exist, but nevertheless the performance of multi-voxel fMRI analyses is very likely to be dominated by a largerscale organization, even if this organization is very weak. Up to now, most arguments are indirect in nature: they do not in themselves proof or contradict sub-voxel sensitivity, but they are suggestive, seem consistent or not with sub-voxel sensitivity, or show that the principle might or might not work. Here the previously proposed smoothing argument against hyperacuity is extended with simulations that include more realistic signal, noise, and analysis properties than any of the simulations presented before. These simulations confirm the relevance of the smoothing approach to find out the scale of the functional maps that underlie the outcome of multi-voxel analyses, at least in relative terms (differences in the scale of different maps). However, image smoothing, like most other arguments in the literature, is an indirect argument, and at the end of the day such arguments are not sufficient to decide the issue on whether and how much sub-voxel maps contribute. A few suggestions are made about the type of evidence that is needed to help us understand the as yet mysterious underpinnings of multi-voxel fMRI analyses.},

First, to collect clear, informative and scalable problems that capture key issues in the design of general and efficient learning algorithms. Second, to study agent behaviour through their performance on these shared benchmarks. To complement this effort, we open source github.com/deepmind/bsuite, which automates evaluation and analysis of any agent on bsuite. This library facilitates reproducible and accessible research on the core issues in RL, and ultimately the design of superior learning algorithms. Our code is Python, and easy to use within existing projects. We include examples with OpenAI Baselines, Dopamine as well as new reference implementations. Going forward, we hope to incorporate more excellent experiments from the research community, and commit to a periodic review of bsuite from a committee of prominent researchers.},

@article{Ostojic2011,
	Abstract = {Neurons transform time-varying inputs into action potentials emitted stochastically at a time dependent rate. The mapping from current input to output firing rate is often represented with the help of phenomenological models such as the linearnonlinear (LN) cascade, in which the output firing rate is estimated by applying to the input successively a linear temporal filter and a static non-linear transformation. These simplified models leave out the biophysical details of action potential generation. It is not a priori clear to which extent the input-output mapping of biophysically more realistic, spiking neuron models can be reduced to a simple linear-nonlinear cascade. Here we investigate this question for the leaky integrate-andfire (LIF), exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) and conductance-based Wang-Buzsa\textasciiacute{}ki models in presence of background synaptic activity. We exploit available analytic results for these models to determine the corresponding linear filter and static non-linearity in a parameter-free form. We show that the obtained functions are identical to the linear filter and static nonlinearity determined using standard reverse correlation analysis. We then quantitatively compare the output of the corresponding linear-nonlinear cascade with numerical simulations of spiking neurons, systematically varying the parameters of input signal and background noise. We find that the LN cascade provides accurate estimates of the firing rates of spiking neurons in most of parameter space. For the EIF and Wang-Buzsa\textasciiacute{}ki models, we show that the LN cascade can be reduced to a firing rate model, the timescale of which we determine analytically. Finally we introduce an adaptive timescale rate model in which the timescale of the linear filter depends on the instantaneous firing rate. This model leads to highly accurate estimates of instantaneous firing rates.},

	Abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range ({$\sim$}100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30\textdegree, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activitydependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy).},

Here, we propose a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) model with a rational function in order to represent the neuronal spike detected by an electrode located in the surroundings of the nerve cell. The model is presented as a cascade association of two subsystems: one that generates an action potential from an input stimulus, and one that represents the medium between the cell and the electrode. The suggested approach employs system identification and signal processing concepts, and is dissociated from any considerations about the biophysical processes of the neuronal cell, providing a low-complexity alternative to model the neuronal spike. The model is validated by using in vivo experimental readings of intracellular and extracellular signals. A computational simulation of the model is presented in order to assess its proximity to the neuronal signal and to observe the variability of the estimated parameters. The implications of the results are discussed in the context of spike sorting.},

@article{Panzeri2008,
	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used method for studying the neural basis of cognition and of sensory function. A potential problem in the interpretation of fMRI data is that fMRI measures neural activity only indirectly, as a local change of deoxyhemoglobin concentration due to the metabolic demands of neural function. To build correct sensory and cognitive maps in the human brain, it is thus crucial to understand whether fMRI and neural activity convey the same type of information about external correlates. While a substantial experimental effort has been devoted to the simultaneous recordings of hemodynamic and neural signals, so far, the development of analysis methods that elucidate how neural and hemodynamic signals represent sensory information has received less attention. In this article, we critically review why the analytical framework of information theory, the mathematical theory of communication, is ideally suited to this purpose. We review the principles of information theory and explain how they could be applied to the analysis of fMRI and neural signals. We show that a critical advantage of information theory over more traditional analysis paradigms commonly used in the fMRI literature is that it can elucidate, within a single framework, whether an empirically observed correlation between neural and fMRI signals reflects either a similar stimulus tuning or a common source of variability unrelated to the external stimuli. In addition, information theory determines the extent to which these shared sources of stimulus signal and of variability lead fMRI and neural signals to convey similar information about external correlates. We then illustrate the formalism by applying it to the analysis of the information carried by different bands of the local field potential. We conclude by discussing the current methodological challenges that need to be addressed to make the information-theoretic approach more robustly applicable to the simultaneous recordings of neural and imaging data.},

While the mechanism of this oscillation continues to be debated, it has been shown to bear positive relation to memory capacity, attention and a host of other cognitive outcomes. Here we show that this feature is largely undetected in the EEG of adults without post-primary education and access to modern technologies. Furthermore, we show that the spatial extent and energy of the oscillation have wide variation, with energy ranging over a thousand fold across the breath of humanity with no centralizing mean. This represents a divergence in a fundamental functional characteristic of an organ demonstrating both that modernization has had a profound influence on brain dynamics and that a meaningful `average' human brain does not exist in a dynamical sense.},

Choline-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure the synaptic release of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) at a sub-second resolution in rats performing a task involving the detection of cues. Cues that were detected, defined behaviorally, evoked transient increases in cholinergic activity (at the scale of seconds) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in a non-associational control region (motor cortex). In trials involving missed cues, cholinergic transients were not observed. Cholinergic deafferentation of the mPFC, but not motor cortex, impaired cue detection. Furthermore, decreases and increases in pre-cue cholinergic activity predicted subsequent cue detection or misses, respectively. Finally, cue-evoked cholinergic transients were superimposed over slower (at the time scale of minutes) changes in cholinergic activity. Cortical cholinergic neurotransmission is regulated on multiple time scales to mediate the detection of behaviorally significant cues and to support cognitive performance.},

@techreport{Park2017,
	Abstract = {The efficient coding hypothesis, which proposes that neurons are optimized to maximize information about the environment, has provided a guiding theoretical framework for sensory and systems neuroscience. More recently, a theory known as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis has focused on the brain's ability to integrate sensory and prior sources of information in order to perform Bayesian inference. However, there is as yet no comprehensive theory connecting these two theoretical frameworks. Here we bridge this gap by formalizing a Bayesian theory of efficient coding. We define Bayesian efficient codes in terms of four basic ingredients: (1) a stimulus prior distribution; (2) an encoding model; (3) a capacity constraint, specifying a neural resource limit; and (4) a loss function, quantifying the desirability or undesirability of various posterior distributions. Classic efficient codes can be seen as a special case in which the loss function is the posterior entropy, leading to a code that maximizes mutual information, but alternate loss functions give solutions that differ dramatically from information-maximizing codes. In particular, we show that decorrelation of sensory inputs, which is optimal under classic efficient codes in low-noise settings, can be disadvantageous for loss functions that penalize large errors. Bayesian efficient coding therefore enlarges the family of normatively optimal codes and provides a more general framework for understanding the design principles of sensory systems. We examine Bayesian efficient codes for linear receptive fields and nonlinear input-output functions, and show that our theory invites reinterpretation of Laughlin's seminal analysis of efficient coding in the blowfly visual system.},

We measured the distributed fMRI activation patterns for different color stimuli (Experiment 1: cardinal colors (to which the LGN is known to be tuned), Experiment 2: perceptual hues) in V1. Our two main findings were that (i) cone-opponent cardinal color modulations produce highly reproducible patterns of activity in V1, but these were not unique to each color. This suggests that V1 neurons with tuning characteristics similar to those found in LGN are not spatially clustered. (ii) Unique activation patterns for perceptual hues in V1 support current evidence for a spatially clustered hue map. We believe that our work is the first to show evidence of spatial clustering of neurons with similar color preferences in human V1.},

@article{Parpart2018,
	Abstract = {Simple heuristics are often regarded as tractable decision strategies because they ignore a great deal of information in the input data. One puzzle is why heuristics can outperform full-information models, such as linear regression, which make full use of the available information. These ``lessis-more'' effects, in which a relatively simpler model outperforms a more complex model, are prevalent throughout cognitive science, and are frequently argued to demonstrate an inherent advantage of simplifying computation or ignoring information. In contrast, we show at the computational level (where algorithmic restrictions are set aside) that it is never optimal to discard information. Through a formal Bayesian analysis, we prove that popular heuristics, such as tallying and take-the-best, are formally equivalent to Bayesian inference under the limit of infinitely strong priors. Varying the strength of the prior yields a continuum of Bayesian models with the heuristics at one end and ordinary regression at the other. Critically, intermediate models perform better across all our simulations, suggesting that down-weighting information with the appropriate prior is preferable to entirely ignoring it. Rather than because of their simplicity, our analyses suggest heuristics perform well because they implement strong priors that approximate the actual structure of the environment. We end by considering how new heuristics could be derived by infinitely strengthening the priors of other Bayesian models. These formal results have implications for work in psychology, machine learning and economics.},

	Abstract = {In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.},

	Abstract = {Efficient exploration is a long-standing problem in sensorimotor learning. Major advances have been demonstrated in noise-free, non-stochastic domains such as video games and simulation. However, most of these formulations either get stuck in environments with stochastic dynamics or are too inefficient to be scalable to real robotics setups. In this paper, we propose a formulation for exploration inspired by the work in active learning literature. Specifically, we train an ensemble of dynamics models and incentivize the agent to explore such that the disagreement of those ensembles is maximized. This allows the agent to learn skills by exploring in a self-supervised manner without any external reward. Notably, we further leverage the disagreement objective to optimize the agent's policy in a differentiable manner, without using reinforcement learning, which results in a sample-efficient exploration. We demonstrate the efficacy of this formulation across a variety of benchmark environments including stochastic-Atari, Mujoco and Unity. Finally, we implement our differentiable exploration on a real robot which learns to interact with objects completely from scratch.

To further explore this role, we developed a novel hybrid platform to combine operant conditioning and phasespecific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). We trained monkeys, implanted with 96 electrodes arrays in motor cortex, to volitionally enhance local field potential (LFP) beta-band (20-30Hz) activity at selected sites using a brain-machine interface (BMI). We demonstrate that beta oscillations of LFP and single-unit spiking activity increased dramatically with BMI training, and that pre-movement Beta-power was anti-correlated with task performance. We also show that phase-specific ICMS modulated the power and phase of oscillations, shifting local networks between oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Furthermore, ICMS induced phase-dependent effects in animal reaction times and success rates. These findings contribute to unraveling of the functional role of cortical oscillations, and to future development of clinical tools for ameliorating abnormal neuronal activities in brain diseases.},

	Abstract = {Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy relies on both precise neurosurgical targeting and systematic optimization of stimulation settings to achieve beneficial clinical outcomes. One recent advance to improve targeting is the development of DBS arrays (DBSAs) with electrodes segmented both along and around the DBS lead. However, increasing the number of independent electrodes creates the logistical challenge of optimizing stimulation parameters efficiently. Approach. Solving such complex problems with multiple solutions and objectives is well known to occur in biology, in which complex collective behaviors emerge out of swarms of individual organisms engaged in learning through social interactions. Here, we developed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to program DBSAs using a swarm of individual particles representing electrode configurations and stimulation amplitudes. Using a finite element model of motor thalamic DBS, we demonstrate how the PSO algorithm can efficiently optimize a multi-objective function that maximizes predictions of axonal activation in regions of interest (ROI, cerebellar-receiving area of motor thalamus), minimizes predictions of axonal activation in regions of avoidance (ROA, somatosensory thalamus), and minimizes power consumption. Main results. The algorithm solved the multi-objective problem by producing a Pareto front. ROI and ROA activation predictions were consistent across swarms ({$<$}1\% median discrepancy in axon activation). The algorithm was able to accommodate for (1) lead displacement (1 mm) with relatively small ROI ({$\leqslant$}9.2\%) and ROA ({$\leqslant$}1\%) activation changes, irrespective of shift direction; (2) reduction in maximum per-electrode current (by 50\% and 80\%) with ROI activation decreasing by 5.6\% and 16\%, respectively; and (3) disabling electrodes (n = 3 and 12) with ROI activation reduction by 1.8\% and 14\%, respectively. Additionally, comparison between PSO predictions and multicompartment axon model simulations showed discrepancies of {$<$}1\% between approaches. Significance. The PSO algorithm provides a computationally efficient way to program DBS systems especially those with higher electrode counts.},

	Abstract = {Interpreting brain image experiments requires analysis of complex, multivariate data. In recent years, one analysis approach that has grown in popularity is the use of machine learning algorithms to train classifiers to decode stimuli, mental states, behaviours and other variables of interest from fMRI data and thereby show the data contain information about them. In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of `is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely `where is the information' (pattern localization) and `how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).},

For historical and methodological reasons, models describing the brain architecture that supports emotional processes in humans have tended to neglect the basal ganglia, focusing instead on cortical and amygdalar mechanisms. Now, however, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a neurosurgical treatment for Parkinson's disease and obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder, is helping researchers explore the possible functional role of this particular basal ganglion in emotional processes. After reviewing studies that have used DBS in this way, we propose a model in which the STN plays a crucial role in producing temporally organized neural co-activation patterns at the cortical and subcortical levels that are essential for generating emotions and related feelings.},

	Abstract = {Instead of contrasting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals associated with 2 conditions, as customarily done in neuroimaging, we reversed the direction of analysis and probed whether brain signals could be used to ``predict'' perceptual states. We probed the neural correlates of perceptual decisions by ``decoding'' brain states during near-threshold fear detection. Decoding was attempted by using support vector machines and other related techniques. Although previous decoding studies have employed relatively ``blocked'' data, our objective was to probe how the ``moment-to-moment'' fluctuation in fMRI signals across a population of voxels reflected the participant's perceptual decision. Accuracy increased from when 1 region was considered (\textasciitilde{}64\%) to when 10 regions were used (\textasciitilde{}78\%). When the best classifications per subject were averaged, accuracy levels ranged between 74\% and 86\% correct. An information theoretic analysis revealed that the information carried by pairs of regions reliably exceeded the sum of the information carried by individual regions, suggesting that information was combined ``synergistically'' across regions. Our results indicate that the representation of behavioral choice is ``distributed'' across several brain regions. Such distributed encoding may help prepare the organism to appropriately handle emotional stimuli and regulate the associated emotional response upon the conscious decision that a fearful face is present. In addition, the results show that challenging brain states can be decoded with high accuracy even when ``single-trial'' data are employed and suggest that multivariate analysis strategies have considerable potential in helping to elucidate the neural correlates of visual awareness and the encoding of perceptual decisions.},

We've developed a model of hierarchical reinforcement learning that combines both these elements into a stumbler-strategist network. We test transfer performance of this network using Wythoff's game, a gridworld environment with a known optimal strategy.

	Abstract = {The optimal decision to exploit existing rewards, or explore looking for larger rewards, is known to be a mathematically intractable problem. Here we challenge this fundamental result in the learning and decision sciences by showing that there is an optimal solution if exploitation and exploration are treated as independent, but competing, objectives. To make it independent we re-imagine exploration as an open-ended search for any new information, whose value we define with a new set of universal axioms. We prove a reward-information competition can be solved by a deterministic winner-take-all algorithm. This algorithm has the properties expected of an ideal solution to the original dilemma, maximizing total value with no regret. Our work suggests an answer to all exploration-exploitation questions can found by exploring simply to learn, and not to go looking for reward.},

	Abstract = {For all animals the decision to explore comes with a risk of getting less. For example, a foraging bee might find less nectar, or hunting hawk less prey. This loss is often formalized as regret. It's been mathematically proven that exploring an uncertain world with a specific goal always has some regret. This is why exploration-exploitation can be a dilemma. Given this proof we wondered if the common advice to ``focus on learning and not the goal'' might have mathematical merit. So we re-imagined exploration in the dilemma as an open ended search for any new information. We then developed a new minimal description of information value, which generalizes existing ideas like curiosity, novelty and information gain. We use this description to model the dilemma as a competition between strategies that maximize reward and information independently. Here we prove this competition has a no regret solution. When we study this solution in simulation \textendash{} using classic bandit tasks \textendash{} it outperforms standard approaches, especially when rewards are sparse.},

	Abstract = {Neural oscillations are observed ubiquitously in the mammalian brain. However the stability of oscillations is highly variable. Some oscillations are tonic, lasting for seconds or even minutes; others are unstable, appearing only as a single-cycle burst. In a model of hippocampal neurons, we use numerical simulations to show how these different forms of rhythm stability can interact with activity-dependent homeostasis to profoundly alter the modulatory effect of neural oscillations. Under homeostasis, tonic oscillations that are synaptically excitatory have a paradoxical effect; they decrease excitability and desynchronizing firing. Tonic oscillations that are synaptically inhibitory\textendash{}like those in a real hippocampus\textendash{}fail to generate new action potentials and so provoke no homeostatic response. This may explain why the theta rhythm in hippocampus is synaptically inhibitory: inhibitory oscillations don't raise the firing threshold, as excitatory oscillations do, and so can preserve each cell's dynamic range. Based on these simulations, we also speculate that homeostasis may explain why excitatory intra-cortical and intra-layer oscillations often appear as bursts. In our model bursts minimally interact with the slow homeostasis time constant and so retain typical excitatory effects.},

	Abstract = {For all animals the decision to explore comes with a risk of getting less. For example, a foraging bee might find less nectar, or hunting hawk less prey. This loss is often formalized as regret. It's been mathematically proven that exploring an uncertain world with a specific goal always has some regret. This is why exploration-exploitation can be a dilemma. Given this proof we wondered if the common advice to ``focus on learning and not the goal'' might have mathematical merit. So we re-imagined exploration in the dilemma as an open ended search for any new information. We then developed a new minimal description of information value, which generalizes existing ideas like curiosity, novelty and information gain. We use this description to model the dilemma as a competition between strategies that maximize reward and information independently. Here we prove this competition has a no regret solution. When we study this solution in simulation \textendash{} using classic bandit tasks \textendash{} it outperforms standard approaches, especially when rewards are sparse.},

	Abstract = {The concept of locally specialized functions dominates research on higher brain function and its disorders. Locally specialized functions must be complemented by processes that coordinate those functions, however, and impairment of coordinating processes may be central to some psychotic conditions. Evidence for processes that coordinate activity is provided by neurobiological and psychological studies of contextual disambiguation and dynamic grouping. Mechanisms by which this important class of cognitive functions could be achieved include those long-range connections within and between cortical regions that activate synaptic channels via NMDAreceptors, and which control gain through their voltage-dependent mode of operation. An impairment of these mechanisms is central to PCP-psychosis, and the cognitive capabilities that they could provide are impaired in some forms of schizophrenia. We conclude that impaired cognitive coordination due to reduced ion flow through NMDA-channels is involved in schizophrenia, and we suggest that it may also be involved in other disorders. This perspective suggests several ways in which further research could enhance our understanding of cognitive coordination, its neural basis, and its relevance to psychopathology.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a neural field model for local (mesoscopic) dynamics on the cortical surface. Our focus is on sparse intrinsic connections that are characteristic of real cortical microcircuits. This sparsity is modelled with radial connectivity functions or kernels with non-central peaks. The ensuing analysis allows one to generate or predict spectral responses to known exogenous input or random fluctuations. Here, we characterise the effect of different connectivity architectures (the range, dispersion and propagation speed of intrinsic or lateral connections) and synaptic gains on spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we look at spectral responses to random fluctuations and examine the ability of synaptic gain and connectivity parameters to induce Turing instabilities. We find that although the spatial deployment and speed of lateral connections can have a profound affect on the behaviour of spatial modes over different scales, only synaptic gain is capable of producing phase-transitions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of neural fields as generative models in dynamic causal modeling (DCM).},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT
          During perceptual decision making, subjects often display a constant rate of errors independent of evidence strength, referred to as ``lapses''. Their proper treatment is crucial for accurate estimation of perceptual parameters, however they are often treated as a nuisance arising from motor errors or inattention. Here, we propose that lapses can instead reflect a dynamic form of exploration. We demonstrate that perceptual uncertainty modulates the probability of lapses both across and within modalities on a multisensory discrimination task in rats. These effects cannot be accounted for by inattention or motor error, however they are concisely explained by uncertainty-guided exploration. We confirm the predictions of the exploration model by showing that changing the magnitude or probability of reward associated with one of the decisions selectively affects the lapses associated with that decision in uncertain conditions, while leaving ``sure-bet'' decisions unchanged, as predicted by the model. Finally, we demonstrate that muscimol inactivations of secondary motor cortex and posterior striatum affect lapses asymmetrically across modalities. The inactivations can be captured by a devaluation of actions corresponding to the inactivated side, and do not affect ``sure-bet'' decisions. Together, our results suggest that far from being a nuisance, lapses are informative about subjects' action values and deficits thereof during perceptual decisions.},

	Abstract = {Neurons have a striking tendency to engage in oscillatory activities. One important type of oscillatory activity prevalent in the motor system occurs in the beta frequency band, at about 20 Hz. It is manifest during the maintenance of tonic contractions and is suppressed prior to and during voluntary movement [1\textendash{}7]. This and other correlative evidence suggests that beta activity might promote tonic contraction, while impairing motor processing related to new movements [3, 8, 9]. Hence, bursts of beta activity in the cortex are associated with a strengthening of the motor effects of sensory feedback during tonic contraction and with reductions in the velocity of voluntary movements [9\textendash{}11]. Moreover, beta activity is increased when movement has to be resisted or voluntarily suppressed [7, 12, 13]. Here we use imperceptible transcranial alternating-current stimulation to entrain cortical activity at 20 Hz in healthy subjects and show that this slows voluntary movement. The present findings are the first direct evidence of causality between any physiological oscillatory brain activity and concurrent motor behavior in the healthy human and help explain how the exaggerated beta activity found in Parkinson's disease can lead to motor slowing in this illness [14].},

Using a detailed compartmental model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell, we recorded responses to complex stimuli consisting of dozens of high-frequency activated synapses distributed throughout the apical dendrites. We found the cell's firing rate could be predicted by a simple formula that maps the physical components of the cell onto those of an abstract two-layer ``neural network.'' In the first layer, synaptic inputs drive independent sigmoidal subunits corresponding to the cell's several dozen long, thin terminal dendrites. The subunit outputs are then summed within the main trunk and cell body prior to final thresholding. We conclude that insofar as the neural code is mediated by average firing rate, a twolayer neural network may provide a useful abstraction for the computing function of the individual pyramidal neuron.},

Here we use in vivo cell-attached and wholecell voltage-clamp recordings to reveal how excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input govern odor representations in rat primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. We show that odors evoke spiking activity that is sparse across the cortical population. We find that unbalanced synaptic excitation and inhibition underlie sparse activity: inhibition is widespread and broadly tuned, while excitation is less common and odor-specific. ``Global'' inhibition can be explained by local interneurons that receive ubiquitous and nonselective odor-evoked excitation. In the temporal domain, while respiration imposes a slow rhythm to olfactory cortical responses, odors evoke fast (15-30 Hz) oscillations in synaptic activity. Oscillatory excitation precedes inhibition, generating brief time windows for precise and temporally sparse spike output. Together, our results reveal that global inhibition and oscillations are major synaptic mechanisms shaping odor representations in olfactory cortex.},

These alpha oscillations are amongst the most widely studied cerebral signals, related to cognitive phenomena such as attention, memory and consciousness. However, the mechanisms by which alpha oscillations affect cognition await demonstration. Here we provide a novel model system from an adequately described complex neural circuit of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), that exhibits properties of the alpha oscillations. We found a prominent alpha wavelike ongoing neural activity (\textasciitilde{} 18 Hz) that is reduced in amplitude upon stimulus presentation. The phase of this alpha activity biased both neuronal spikes and amplitude of high frequency gamma activity ({$>$} 30 Hz). These results suggest a common role of oscillatory neuronal activity across phyla and provide an unprecedented new venue for causal studies on the relationship between neuronal spikes, brain oscillations and cognition.},

Astrocytes, a type of glial cells classically considered to be passive supportive cells, have been recently demonstrated to be actively involved in the processing and regulation of synaptic information, suggesting that brain function arises from the activity of neuron-glia networks. However, the actual impact of astrocytes in neural network function is largely unknown and its application in artificial intelligence remains untested.

	Abstract = {In the past decade, the cell-type specific connectivity and activity of local cortical networks have been characterized experimentally to some detail. In parallel, modeling has been established as a tool to relate network structure to activity dynamics. While available comprehensive connectivity maps (Thomson, West, et al. 2002; Binzegger et al. 2004) have been used in various computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity such as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings. Here, we analyze the properties of these maps to compile an integrated connectivity map, which additionally incorporates insights on the specific selection of target types. Based on this integrated map, we build a full-scale spiking network model of the local cortical microcircuit. The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and cell-type specific firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. The interplay of excitation and inhibition captures the flow of activity through cortical layers after transient thalamic stimulation. In conclusion, the integration of a large body of the available connectivity data enables us to expose the dynamical consequences of the cortical microcircuitry.},

	Abstract = {In past decades, the Bayesian paradigm has gained traction as a principled account of human behavior in inference tasks. Yet this success is tainted by the ubiquity of behavioral suboptimality and variability. We explore these discrepancies using an online inference task, in which we modulate the temporal statistics of hidden change points. We show that humans adapt their inference process to the implicit temporal statistics of stimuli, thereby behaving in an approximate Bayesian fashion. However, they exhibit biases and variability, and these depend on the history of stimuli. A systematic study of a broad family of optimal and suboptimal models indicates that noise arises `internally'\textemdash{}in the inference process itself\textemdash{}rather than at the behavioral output. Specifically, we argue that humans mimic Bayesian inference by approximating the posterior with a modest number of samples. Our results contribute to a growing literature on sample-based cognition and compression by stochastic pruning.},

	Abstract = {The existence of multiple parallel loops connecting sensorimotor systems to the basal ganglia has given rise to proposals that these nuclei serve as a selection mechanism resolving competitions between the alternative actions available in a given context. A strong test of this hypothesis is to require a computational model of the basal ganglia to generate integrated selection sequences in an autonomous agent, we therefore describe a robot architecture into which such a model is embedded, and require it to control action selection in a robotic task inspired by animal observations. Our results demonstrate effective action selection by the embedded model under a wide range of sensory and motivational conditions. When confronted with multiple, high salience alternatives, the robot also exhibits forms of behavioral disintegration that show similarities to animal behavior in conflict situations. The model is shown to cast light on recent neurobiological findings concerning behavioral switching and sequencing.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to the conventional role of evolution in evolutionary computation (EC) as an optimization algorithm, a new class of evolutionary algorithms has emerged in recent years that instead aim to accumulate as diverse a collection of discoveries as possible, yet where each variant in the collection is as fit as it can be. Often applied in both neuroevolution and morphological evolution, these new quality diversity (QD) algorithms are particularly well-suited to evolution's inherent strengths, thereby offering a promising niche for EC within the broader field of machine learning. However, because QD algorithms are so new, until now no comprehensive study has yet attempted to systematically elucidate their relative strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Taking a first step in this direction, this paper introduces a new benchmark domain designed specifically to compare and contrast QD algorithms. It then shows how the degree of alignment between the measure of quality and the behavior characterization (which is an essential component of all QD algorithms to date) impacts the ultimate performance of different such algorithms. The hope is that this initial study will help to stimulate interest in QD and begin to unify the disparate ideas in the area.},

	Abstract = {Inspired by natural evolution's affinity for discovering a wide variety of successful organisms, a new evolutionary search paradigm has emerged wherein the goal is not to find the single best solution but rather to collect a diversity of unique phenotypes where each variant is as good as it can be. These quality diversity (QD) algorithms therefore must explore multiple promising niches simultaneously. A QD algorithm's diversity component, formalized by specifying a behavior characterization (BC), not only generates diversity but also promotes quality by helping to overcome deception in the fitness landscape. However, some BCs (particularly those that are unaligned with the notion of quality) do not adequately mitigate deception, rendering QD algorithms unable to discover the best-performing solutions on difficult problems. This paper introduces a solution that enables QD algorithms to pursue arbitrary notions of diversity without compromising their ability to solve hard problems: driving search with multiple BCs simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {Responding to various stimuli, some neurons either remain resting or can fire several distinct patterns of action potentials, such as spiking, bursting, subthreshold oscillations, and chaotic firing. In particular, Wilson's conductance-based neocortical neuron model, derived from the Hodgkin\textendash{}Huxley model, is explored to understand underlying mechanisms of the firing patterns. Phase diagrams describing boundaries between the domains of different firing patterns are obtained via extensive numerical computations. The boundaries are further studied by standard instability analyses, which demonstrates that the chaotic neural firing could develop via period-doubling and/or periodadding cascades. Sequences of the firing patterns often observed in many neural experiments are also discussed in the phase diagram framework developed. Our results lay the groundwork for wider use of the model, especially for incorporating it into neural field modeling of the brain.},

	Abstract = {Extreme events and the related anomalous statistics are ubiquitously observed in many natural systems, and the development of efficient methods to understand and accurately predict such representative features remains a grand challenge. Here, we investigate the skill of deep learning strategies in the prediction of extreme events in complex turbulent dynamical systems. Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to many imaging processing problems involving big data, and have recently shown potential for the study of dynamical systems. We propose to use a densely connected mixed-scale network model to capture the extreme events appearing in a truncated Korteweg\textendash{}de Vries (tKdV) statistical framework, which creates anomalous skewed distributions consistent with recent laboratory experiments for shallow water waves across an abrupt depth change, where a remarkable statistical phase transition is generated by varying the inverse temperature parameter in the corresponding Gibbs invariant measures. The neural network is trained using data without knowing the explicit model dynamics, and the training data are only drawn from the near-Gaussian regime of the tKdV model solutions without the occurrence of large extreme values. A relative entropy loss function, together with empirical partition functions, is proposed for measuring the accuracy of the network output where the dominant structures in the turbulent field are emphasized. The optimized network is shown to gain uniformly high skill in accurately predicting the solutions in a wide variety of statistical regimes, including highly skewed extreme events. The technique is promising to be further applied to other complicated high-dimensional systems.},

	Abstract = {In Golgi preparations of the adult monkey (Macaca mulatta) local interneurons and two varieties of principal neurons, radiating and elongated fusiform, are found in the subthalamic nucleus. The cell bodies of the radiating neurons have a few delicate, somatic spines some of which are occasionally bilobed and trilobed. Five to eight dendritic trunks give rise to branching, tapering dendrites, which may extend for over 400 microns. These dendrites are much thinner than the dendrites in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. Some neurons have many and some neurons have few dendritic spines. When numerous the dendritic spines are concentrated on the dendritic trunks and proximal dendrites. The relatively few elongated fusiform neurons are found not only in the capsule but also i n the center of the nucleus. Most dendrites emerge from the opposite poles of their smooth surfaced cell bodies. They have a few dendritic spines. Some of these dendrites extend for more than 750 microns. In 1-micron thick plastic sections lipofuscin granules are present i n some but not all principal neuron cell bodies of the monkey (Macaca mulatta); but these granules are present i n all principal neuron cell bodies of the pig-tail monkey (Macaca nemestrina) and of the squirrel monkey ( S a i m i r i sciureus).},

	Abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many recent successes, but our understanding of its strengths and limitations is hampered by the lack of rich environments in which we can fully characterize optimal behavior, and correspondingly diagnose individual actions against such a characterization. Here we consider a family of combinatorial games, arising from work of Erdos, Selfridge, and Spencer, and we propose their use as environments for evaluating and comparing different approaches to reinforcement learning. These games have a number of appealing features: they are challenging for current learning approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional, simply parametrized environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution for optimal behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be tuned by changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games not only to compare different algorithms, but test for generalization, make comparisons to supervised learning, analyze multiagent play, and even develop a self play algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Human perceptual decisions are often described as optimal. Critics of this view have argued that claims of optimality are overly flexible and lack explanatory power. Meanwhile, advocates for optimality have countered that such criticisms single out a few selected papers. To elucidate the issue of optimality in perceptual decision making, we review the extensive literature on suboptimal performance in perceptual tasks. We discuss eight different classes of suboptimal perceptual decisions, including improper placement, maintenance, and adjustment of perceptual criteria, inadequate tradeoff between speed and accuracy, inappropriate confidence ratings, misweightings in cue combination, and findings related to various perceptual illusions and biases. In addition, we discuss conceptual shortcomings of a focus on optimality, such as definitional difficulties and the limited value of optimality claims in and of themselves. We therefore advocate that the field drop its emphasis on whether observed behavior is optimal and instead concentrate on building and testing detailed observer models that explain behavior across a wide range of tasks. To facilitate this transition, we compile the proposed hypotheses regarding the origins of suboptimal perceptual decisions reviewed here. We argue that verifying, rejecting, and expanding these explanations for suboptimal behavior - rather than assessing optimality per se - should be among the major goals of the science of perceptual decision making.},

	Abstract = {A key goal of cognitive neuroscience is to find simple and direct connections between brain and behaviour. However, fMRI analysis typically involves choices between many possible options, with each choice potentially biasing any brain\textendash{}behaviour correlations that emerge. Standard methods of fMRI analysis assess each voxel individually, but then face the problem of selection bias when combining those voxels into a region-of-interest, or ROI. Multivariate pattern-based fMRI analysis methods use classifiers to analyse multiple voxels together, but can also introduce selection bias via data-reduction steps as feature selection of voxels, pre-selecting activated regions, or principal components analysis. We show here that strong brain\textendash{}behaviour links can be revealed without any voxel selection or data reduction, using just plain linear regression as a classifier applied to the whole brain at once, i.e. treating each entire brain volume as a single multi-voxel pattern. The brain\textendash{}behaviour correlations emerged despite the fact that the classifier was not provided with any information at all about subjects' behaviour, but instead was given only the neural data and its condition-labels. Surprisingly, more powerful classifiers such as a linear SVM and regularised logistic regression produce very similar results. We discuss some possible reasons why the very simple brain-wide linear regression model is able to find correlations with behaviour that are as strong as those obtained on the one hand from a specific ROI and on the other hand from more complex classifiers. In a manner which is unencumbered by arbitrary choices, our approach offers a method for investigating connections between brain and behaviour which is simple, rigorous and direct.},

Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recurrent network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memoryguided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network architectures.},

Contrary to this, we suggest that older adults' changing performance reflects memory search demands, which escalate as experience grows. A series of simulations show how the performance patterns observed across adulthood emerge naturally in learning models as they acquire knowledge. The simulations correctly identify greater variation in the cognitive performance of older adults, and successfully predict that older adults will show greater sensitivity to fine-grained differences in the properties of test stimuli than younger adults. Our results indicate that older adults' performance on cognitive tests reflects the predictable consequences of learning on informationprocessing, and not cognitive decline. We consider the implications of this for our scientific and cultural understanding of aging.},

            Dendrites of pyramidal neurons integrate different sensory inputs, and non-linear dendritic computations drive feature selective tuning and plasticity. Yet little is known about how dendrites themselves represent the environment, the degree to which they are coupled to their soma, and how that coupling is sculpted with experience. In order to answer these questions, we developed a novel preparation in which we image soma and connected dendrites in a single plane across days using
            in vivo
            two-photon microscopy. Using this preparation, we monitored spatially tuned activity in area CA3 of the hippocampus in head-fixed mice running on a linear track. We identified ``place dendrites'', which can stably and precisely represent both familiar and novel spatial environments. Dendrites could display place tuning independent of their connected soma and even their sister dendritic branches, the first evidence for branch-specific tuning in the hippocampus. In a familiar environment, spatially tuned somata were more decoupled from their dendrites as compared to non-tuned somata. This relationship was absent in a novel environment, suggesting an experience dependent selective gating of dendritic spatial inputs. We then built a data-driven multicompartment computational model that could capture the experimentally observed correlations. Our model predicts that place cells exhibiting branch-specific tuning have more flexible place fields, while neurons with homogenous or co-tuned dendritic branches have higher place field stability. These findings demonstrate that spatial representation is organized in a branch-specific manner within dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Further, spatial inputs from dendrites to soma are selectively and dynamically gated in an experience-dependent manner, endowing both flexibility and stability to the cognitive map of space.

            egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity, and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains \textasciitilde{}12-15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in
            
            is driven by a homeostat that scales serotonin motor neuron activity in response to postsynaptic muscle feedback.},

            Given the stochastic nature of gene expression, genetically identical cells exposed to the same environmental inputs will produce different outputs. This heterogeneity has consequences for how cells are able to survive in changing environments. Recent work has explored the use of information theory as a framework to understand the accuracy with which cells can ascertain the state of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these approaches is limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision measurements. To that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic circuit in which all parameter values for the model come from independently published data sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of the genetic circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy number and protein-DNA affinity.

	Abstract = {Category information for visually presented objects can be read out from multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activity in ventral\textendash{}temporal cortex. What is the nature and reliability of these patterns in the absence of any bottom\textendash{}up visual input, for example, during visual imagery? Here, we first ask how well category information can be decoded for imagined objects and then compare the representations evoked during imagery and actual viewing. In an fMRI study, four object categories (food, tools, faces, buildings) were either visually presented to subjects, or imagined by them. Using pattern classification techniques, we could reliably decode category information (including for non-special categories, i.e., food and tools) from ventral\textendash{}temporal cortex in both conditions, but only during actual viewing from retinotopic areas. Interestingly, in temporal cortex when the classifier was trained on the viewed condition and tested on the imagery condition, or vice versa, classification performance was comparable to within the imagery condition. The above results held even when we did not use information in the specialized category-selective areas. Thus, the patterns of representation during imagery and actual viewing are in fact surprisingly similar to each other. Consistent with this observation, the maps of ``diagnostic voxels'' (i.e., the classifier weights) for the perception and imagery classifiers were more similar in ventral\textendash{}temporal cortex than in retinotopic cortex. These results suggest that in the absence of any bottom\textendash{}up input, cortical back projections can selectively re-activate specific patterns of neural activity.},

	Abstract = {Proper balance between exploitation and exploration is what makes good decisions, which achieve high rewards like payoff or evolutionary fitness. The Infomax principle postulates that maximization of information directs the function of diverse systems, from living systems to artificial neural networks. While specific applications are successful, the validity of information as a proxy for reward remains unclear. Here, we consider the multi-armed bandit decision problem, which features arms (slot-machines) of unknown probabilities of success and a player trying to maximize cumulative payoff by choosing the sequence of arms to play. We show that an Infomax strategy (Info-p) which optimally gathers information on the highest mean reward among the arms saturates known optimal bounds and compares favorably to existing policies. The highest mean reward considered by Info-p is not the quantity actually needed for the choice of the arm to play, yet it allows for optimal tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation.},

The simplest linear oscillator-based tremor model, between stimulation amplitude and tremor, is investigated by utilizing input-output knowledge. Further, a nonlinear generalization of the oscillator-based tremor model, useful for derivation of a control strategy involving incorporation of parametric-bound knowledge, is provided. Using the Lyapunov method, a robust adaptive output feedback control law, based on measurement of the tremor signal from the fingers of a patient, is formulated to estimate the stimulation amplitude required to control the tremor. By means of the proposed control strategy, an algorithm is developed for estimation of DBS parameters such as amplitude, frequency and pulse width, which provides a framework for development of an automatic clinical device for control of motor symptoms. The DBS parameter estimation results for the proposed control scheme are verified through numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

	Abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

However, a computational model specifying how people select strategies from their repertoire is still lacking. The proposed strategy selection learning (SSL) theory predicts a strategy selection process on the basis of reinforcement learning. The theory assumes that individuals develop subjective expectations for the strategies they have and select strategies proportional to their expectations, which are then updated on the basis of subsequent experience. The learning assumption was supported in 4 experimental studies. Participants substantially improved their inferences through feedback. In all 4 studies, the best-performing strategy from the participants' repertoires most accurately predicted the inferences after sufficient learning opportunities. When testing SSL against 3 models representing extensions of SSL and against an exemplar model assuming a memory-based inference process, the authors found that SSL predicted the inferences most accurately.},

	Abstract = {Neural architectures inspired by our own human cognitive system, such as the recently introduced world models, have been shown to outperform traditional deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods in a variety of different domains. Instead of the relatively simple architectures employed in most RL experiments, world models rely on multiple different neural components that are responsible for visual information processing, memory, and decision-making. However, so far the components of these models have to be trained separately and through a variety of specialized training methods. This paper demonstrates the surprising finding that models with the same precise parts can be instead efficiently trained end-to-end through a genetic algorithm (GA), reaching a comparable performance to the original world model by solving a challenging car racing task. An analysis of the evolved visual and memory system indicates that they include a similar effective representation to the system trained through gradient descent. Additionally, in contrast to gradient descent methods that struggle with discrete variables, GAs also work directly with such representations, opening up opportunities for classical planning in latent space. This paper adds additional evidence on the effectiveness of deep neuroevolution for tasks that require the intricate orchestration of multiple components in complex heterogeneous architectures.},

At the single-neuron level, the new approaches involve reformulation of dynamics in synapses, dendrites, cell bodies, and axons to enable new types of analysis, longer numerical timesteps, and demonstration that rate-based methods can predict spike times. In multineuron systems, hybrids and intermediates between spike-based and field-based coupling between neurons are used to provide stepping stones between descriptions based on pairwise spike-based interactions between neurons and ones based on neural field-based interactions within and between populations, including arbitrary spatial structure and temporal delays in the connections in general. In particular, a new neuronin-cell approach is introduced that is a hybrid between neural field theory and spiking-neuron models in analogy to particle-in-cell methods in plasma physics. This approach enables large speedups in computations while preserving spike shapes and times. Various approaches are illustrated numerically for specific cases.},

In contrast, low-dimensional embeddings (i.e. distributional representations) are efficient and enable generalization, but it is unclear how reasoning with embeddings could support the full power of symbolic representations such as first-order logic.

	Abstract = {The control of locomotion is fundamental to vertebrate animal survival. Defensive situations require an animal to rapidly decide whether to run away or suppress locomotor activity to avoid detection. While much of the neural circuitry involved in defensive action selection has been elucidated, top-down modulation of brainstem locomotor circuitry remains unclear. Here we provide evidence for the existence and functionality of a monosynaptic connection from the central amygdala (CeA) to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that inhibits locomotion in unconditioned and conditioned defensive behavior in mice. We show that locomotion stimulated by airpuff coincides with increased activity of MLR glutamatergic neurons. Using retrograde tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology, we find that the CeA makes a monosynaptic connection with the MLR. In the open field, in vivo stimulation of this projection suppressed spontaneous locomotion, whereas inhibition of this projection had no effect. However, inhibiting CeA terminals within the MLR increased both neural activity and locomotor responses to airpuff. Finally, using a conditioned avoidance paradigm known to activate CeA neurons, we find that inhibition of the CeA projection increased successful escape, whereas activating the projection reduced escape. Together these results provide evidence for a new circuit substrate influencing locomotion and defensive behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian learning methods have recently been shown to provide an elegant solution to the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning. However most investigations of Bayesian reinforcement learning to date focus on the standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The primary focus of this paper is to extend these ideas to the case of partially observable domains, by introducing the Bayes-Adaptive Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. This new framework can be used to simultaneously (1) learn a model of the POMDP domain through interaction with the environment, (2) track the state of the system under partial observability, and (3) plan (near-)optimal sequences of actions. An important contribution of this paper is to provide theoretical results showing how the model can be finitely approximated while preserving good learning performance. We present approximate algorithms for belief tracking and planning in this model, as well as empirical results that illustrate how the model estimate and agent's return improve as a function of experience.},

	Abstract = {A method is presented for the reduction of morphologically detailed microcircuit models to a point-neuron representation without human intervention. The simplification occurs in a modular workflow, in the neighborhood of a user specified network activity state for the reference model, the ``operating point''. First, synapses are moved to the soma, correcting for dendritic filtering by low-pass filtering the delivered synaptic current. Filter parameters are computed numerically and independently for inhibitory and excitatory input on the basal and apical dendrites, respectively, in a distance dependent and post-synaptic m-type specific manner. Next, point-neuron models for each neuron in the microcircuit are fit to their respective morphologically detailed counterparts. Here, generalized integrate-and-fire point neuron models are used, leveraging a recently published fitting toolbox. The fits are constrained by currents and voltages computed in the morphologically detailed partner neurons with soma corrected synapses at three depolarizations about the user specified operating point. The result is a simplified circuit which is well constrained by the reference circuit, and can be continuously updated as the latter iteratively integrates new data. The modularity of the approach makes it applicable also for other point-neuron and synapse models.},

Clearly, in many situations people do indeed judge likelihood. However, we present studies suggesting that there are also many situations in which people do not judge likelihood and instead base their decisions on intuitively generated, non-probabilistic rules or rationales. Thus, we argue that real-world situations are of two types. In situations eliciting a probabilistic mindset, people rely on judgments of likelihood. In situations eliciting a non-probabilistic mindset, they neglect judgments of likelihood. We suggest three factors that may inXuence the tendency towards either probabilistic or non-probabilistic mindsets. We also outline how extant probabilistic theories may be complemented by non-probabilistic models.},

	Abstract = {A current challenge of neurotechnologies is the development of speech brain-computer interfaces to restore communication in people unable to speak. To achieve a proof of concept of such system, neural activity can be investigated in patients implanted for clinical reasons while they speak. Using such simultaneously recorded audio and neural data, decoders can be built to predict speech features using features extracted from brain signals. A typical neural feature is the spectral power of field potentials in the high-gamma frequency band (between 70 and 200 Hz), a range that happen to overlap with the fundamental frequency of speech. Here, we analyzed human electrocorticographic (ECoG) and intracortical recordings during speech production and perception as well as rat microelectrocorticographic (\textmu{}-ECoG) recordings during sound perception. We observed that electrophysiological recordings, obtained with different recording setups, often contain spectrotemporal features of the sound, especially within the high-gamma band. Further analysis and in vitro replication suggest that these correlations are caused by a microphonic effect, transforming sound vibrations into an undesired electrical noise that contaminates the biopotential measurements. This study does not question the existence of relevant physiological neural information underlying speech production or sound perception in the high-gamma frequency band, but alerts on the fact that care should be taken to evaluate and eliminate any possible acoustic contamination of neural signals to investigate cortical dynamics underlying speech production and auditory perception.},

	Abstract = {Race models have been used to explain perceptual, motor and oculomotor decisions. Here we developed a race model to explain how human subjects select actions when there are no overt rewards and no external cues to specify which action to make. Critically, we were able to estimate the cumulative activity of neuronal decision-units for selected and non-selected actions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test for regional brain activity that correlated with the predictions of this race model. Activity in the preSMA, cingulate motor and premotor areas correlated with prospective selection between responses according to the race model. Activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex did not correlate with the race model, even though this area was active during action selection. This activity related to the degree to which individuals switched between alternative actions. Crucially, a follow-up experiment showed that it was not present on the first trial. Taken together, these results suggest that the lateral prefrontal cortex is not the source for the generation of action. It is more likely that it is involved in switching to alternatives or monitoring previous actions. Thus, our experiment shows the power of the race model in distinguishing the contribution of different areas in the selection of action.},

	Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) has recently been recognized as an important form of intervention for alleviating motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, but the mechanism underlying its effectiveness remains unknown. Using a computational model, this paper considers the hypothesis that DBS works by replacing pathologically rhythmic basal ganglia output with tonic, high frequency firing. In our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals. High frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result. We provide a mathematical phase plane analysis of the mechanisms that determine TC relay capabilities in normal, parkinsonian, and DBS states in a reduced model. This analysis highlights the differences in deinactivation of the low-threshold calcium T -current that we observe in TC cells in these different conditions. Alternative scenarios involving convergence of thalamic signals in the cortex are also discussed, and predictions associated with these results, including the occurrence of rhythmic rebound bursts in certain TC cells in parkinsonian states and their drastic reduction by DBS, are stated. These results demonstrate how DBS could work by increasing firing rates of target cells, rather than shutting them down.},

In this setting, belief elicitation improves the goodness of fit of structural models of belief learning, and the prior beliefs implied by such structural models are both stronger and more realistic when beliefs are elicited than when they are not. These effects are, however, confined to the player type who sees a strong asymmetry between payoff possibilities for her two strategies in the game.

	Abstract = {The intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei are part of the higher-order thalamus, which receives little sensory input, and instead forms extensive cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. The large mediodorsal thalamic nucleus predominantly connects with the prefrontal cortex, the adjacent intralaminar nuclei connect with fronto-parietal cortex, and the midline thalamic nuclei connect with medial prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe. Taking into account this connectivity pattern, it is not surprising that the intralaminar and medial thalamus has been implicated in a variety of cognitive functions, including memory processing, attention and orienting, as well as reward-based behavior. This review addresses how the intralaminar and medial thalamus may regulate information transmission in cortical circuits. A key neural mechanism may involve intralaminar and medial thalamic neurons modulating the degree of synchrony between different groups of cortical neurons according to behavioral demands. Such a thalamic-mediated synchronization mechanism may give rise to large-scale integration of information across multiple cortical circuits, consequently influencing the level of arousal and consciousness. Overall, the growing evidence supports a general role for the higher-order thalamus in the control of cortical information transmission and cognitive processing.},

	Abstract = {Animal behaviour depends on learning to associate sensory stimuli with the desired motor command. Understanding how the brain orchestrates the necessary synaptic modifications across different brain areas has remained a longstanding puzzle. Here, we introduce a multi-area neuronal network model in which synaptic plasticity continuously adapts the network towards a global desired output. In this model synaptic learning is driven by a local dendritic prediction error that arises from a failure to predict the top-down input given the bottom-up activities. Such errors occur at apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons where both long-range excitatory feedback and local inhibitory predictions are integrated. When local inhibition fails to match excitatory feedback an error occurs which triggers plasticity at bottom-up synapses at basal dendrites of the same pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in a number of tasks and show that it approximates the classical error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, complementing this cortical circuit with a disinhibitory mechanism enables attention-like stimulus denoising and generation. Our framework makes several experimental predictions on the function of dendritic integration and cortical microcircuits, is consistent with recent observations of cross-area learning, and suggests a biological implementation of deep learning.},

	Abstract = {Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind these advances \textendash{} error backpropagation \textendash{} appears to be at odds with neurobiology. Here, we introduce a multilayer neuronal network model with simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback. Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic credit assignment problem.},

	Abstract = {Background. The availability of smartphone and wearable sensor technology is leading to a rapid accumulation of human subject data, and machine learning is emerging as a technique to map that data into clinical predictions. As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is vital to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation is the standard approach where the accuracy of such algorithms is evaluated on data the algorithm has not seen during training. However, for this procedure to be meaningful, the relationship between the training and validation set should mimic the relationship between the training set and the dataset expected for the clinical use. Here we compared two popular cross-validation methods: record-wise and subject-wise. The subjectwise procedure mirrors the clinically relevant use-case scenario of diagnosing/identifying patterns in newly recruited subjects. The record-wise strategy has no such interpretation.
Results. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise crossvalidation often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature, and found that this overly optimistic method is used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes.
Conclusions. As we move towards an era of machine learning based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as results that are overly optimistic can mislead both clinicians and data scientists.},

	Abstract = {Previous research on the superior temporal sulcus (STS) has shown that it responds more to facial expressions than to neutral faces. Here, we extend our understanding of the STS in two ways. First, using targeted high-resolution fMRI measurements of the lateral cortex and multivoxel pattern analysis, we show that the response to seven categories of dynamic facial expressions can be decoded in both the posterior STS (pSTS) and anterior STS (aSTS). We were also able to decode patterns corresponding to these expressions in the frontal operculum (FO), a structure that has also been shown to respond to facial expressions. Second, we measured the similarity structure of these representations and found that the similarity structure in the pSTS significantly correlated with the perceptual similarity structure of the expressions. This was the case regardless of whether we used pattern classification or more traditional correlation techniques to extract the neural similarity structure. These results suggest that distributed representations in the pSTS could underlie the perception of facial expressions.},

We investigated the source of narrowband gamma, the factors modulating its strength, and its relationship to broadband gamma. Narrowband and broadband gamma power were uncorrelated. Increasing visual contrast had opposite effects on the two kinds of gamma activity: it increased broadband power, but suppressed the narrowband oscillation. Narrowband power was strongest in layer 4, and was mediated primarily by excitatory currents entrained by rhythmically firing neuronal ensembles in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Silencing the cortex optogenetically did not affect narrowband rhythmicity in either LGN spike trains or cortical EPSCs, suggesting that this oscillation reflects unidirectional flow of information from LGN to V1.},

	Abstract = {Evidence suggests that scalp-recorded occipital alpha-band (8\textendash{}13 Hz) oscillations reflect phasic information transfer in thalamocortical neurons projecting from lateral geniculate nucleus to visual cortex [1\textendash{}5]. In animals, the phase of ongoing alpha oscillations has been shown to modulate stimulus discrimination and neuronal spiking [6]. Human research has shown that alpha phase predicts visual perception of nearthreshold stimuli [7\textendash{}11] and subsequent neural activity [12\textendash{}14] and that the frequency of these oscillations predicts reaction times [15], as well as the maximum temporal interval necessary for perceived simultaneity [16]. These phasic effects have led to the hypothesis that conscious perception occurs in discrete temporal windows, clocked by the frequency of alpha oscillations [17\textendash{}21]. Under this hypothesis, variation in the frequency of occipital alpha oscillations should predict variation in the temporal resolution of visual perception. Specifically, when two stimuli fall within the same alpha cycle, they may be perceived as a single stimulus, resulting in perception with lower temporal resolution when alpha frequency is lower. We tested this by assessing the relationship between two-flash fusion thresholds (a measure of the temporal resolution of visual perception) and the frequency of eyes-closed and task-related alpha rhythms. We found, both between and within subjects, that faster alpha frequencies predicted more accurate flash discrimination, providing novel evidence linking alpha frequency to the temporal resolution of perception.},

@article{Sapountzis2010,
	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a ubiquitous tool in cognitive neuroscience. The technique allows noninvasive measurements of cortical responses in the human brain, but only on the millimeter scale. Because a typical voxel contains many thousands of neurons with varied properties, establishing the selectivity of their responses directly is impossible. In recent years, two methods using fMRI aimed at studying the selectivity of neuronal populations on a `subvoxel' scale have been heavily used. The first technique, fMRI adaptation, relies on the observation that the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in a given voxel is reduced after prolonged presentation of a stimulus, and that this reduction is selective to the characteristics of the repeated stimuli (adapters). The second technique, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), makes use of multivariate statistics to recover small biases in individual voxels in their responses to different stimuli. It is thought that these biases arise due to the uneven distribution of neurons (with different properties) sampled by the many voxels in the imaged volume. These two techniques have not been compared explicitly, however, and little is known about their relative sensitivities. Here, we compared fMRI results from orientation-specific visual adaptation and orientation\textendash{}classification by MVPA, using optimized experimental designs for each, and found that the multivariate pattern classification approach was more sensitive to small differences in stimulus orientation than the adaptation paradigm. Estimates of orientation selectivity obtained with the two methods were, however, very highly correlated across visual areas.},

	Abstract = {Axonal projections arising from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were traced after labeling small pools (5\textendash{}15 cells) of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Seventy-five single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Most of the STN labeled cells displayed five to eight long, sparsely spined dendrites that arborized mostly along the main axis of the nucleus. Based on their axonal targets, five distinct types of STN projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons projecting to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the internal (GPi) and external (GPe) segments of the globus pallidus (21.3\%); 2) neurons targeting SNr and GPe (2.7\%); 3) neurons projecting to GPi and GPe (48\%); 4) neurons targeting GPe only (10.7 \%); and 5) neurons with axons that coursed toward the sriatum, but whose terminal arborization could not be visualized in detail (17.3\%). Axons of the first two types bifurcated into rostral subthalamopallidal and caudal pallidonigral branches. However, the majority of STN axons had only a single branch that coursed rostrally toward the pallidum and striatum. These results reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate STN is not a monolithic entity. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons, each endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals. This organization allows STN neurons to exert a multifarious effect not only on the GPe, with which the STN is reciprocally connected, but also on the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, the SNr and the GPi.

	Abstract = {Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.},

	Abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that the elaborated calcium signals and the occurrence of calcium waves in astrocytes provide these cells with a specific form of excitability. The identification of the cellular and molecular steps involved in the triggering and transmission of Ca21 waves between astrocytes resulted in the identification of two pathways mediating this form of intercellular communication. One of them involves the direct communication between the cytosols of two adjoining cells through gap junction channels, while the other depends upon the release of ``gliotransmitters'' that activates membrane receptors on neighboring cells. In this review we summarize evidence in favor of these two mechanisms of Ca21 wave transmission and we discuss that they may not be mutually exclusive, but are likely to work in conjunction to coordinate the activity of a group of cells. To address a key question regarding the functional consequences following the passage of a Ca21 wave, we list, in this review, some of the potential intracellular targets of these Ca21 transients in astrocytes, and discuss the functional consequences of the activation of these targets for the interactions that astrocytes maintain with themselves and with other cellular partners, including those at the glial/vasculature interface and at perisynaptic sites where astrocytic processes tightly interact with neurons.

	Abstract = {Firing-rate models provide an attractive approach for studying large neural networks because they can be simulated rapidly and are amenable to mathematical analysis. Traditional firing-rate models assume a simple form in which the dynamics are governed by a single time constant. These models fail to replicate certain dynamic features of populations of spiking neurons, especially those involving synchronization. We present a complex-valued firing-rate model derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to the linear, quadratic and exponential integrate-andfire models. Despite being almost as simple as a traditional firing-rate description, this model can reproduce firing-rate dynamics due to partial synchronization of the action potentials in a spiking model, and it successfully predicts the transition to spike synchronization in networks of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons.},

	Abstract = {Relating behavioral and neuroimaging measures is essential to understanding human brain function. Often, this is achieved by computing a correlation between behavioral measures, e.g., reaction times, and neurophysiological recordings, e.g., prestimulus EEG alpha-power, on a single-trial-basis. This approach treats individual trials as independent measurements and ignores the fact that data are acquired in a temporal order. It has already been shown that behavioral measures as well as neurophysiological recordings display power-law dynamics, which implies that trials are not in fact independent. Critically, computing the correlation coefficient between two measures exhibiting long-range temporal dependencies may introduce spurious correlations, thus leading to erroneous conclusions about the relationship between brain activity and behavioral measures. Here, we address data-analytic pitfalls which may arise when long-range temporal dependencies in neural as well as behavioral measures are ignored. We quantify the influence of temporal dependencies of neural and behavioral measures on the observed correlations through simulations. Results are further supported in analysis of real EEG data recorded in a simple reaction time task, where the aim is to predict the latency of responses on the basis of prestimulus alpha oscillations. We show that it is possible to "predict" reaction times from one subject on the basis of EEG activity recorded in another subject simply owing to the fact that both measures display power-law dynamics. The same is true when correlating EEG activity obtained from different subjects. A surrogatedata procedure is described which correctly tests for the presence of correlation while controlling for the effect of power-law dynamics. Hum Brain Mapp 00:000\textendash{}000, 2015.

Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, nonarbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve.

It generalizes the traditional field of active learning, and is related to old but less formal ideas in aesthetics theory and developmental psychology. It has been argued that the theory explains many essential aspects of intelligence including autonomous development, science, art, music, humor. This overview first describes theoretically optimal (but not necessarily practical) ways of implementing the basic computational principles on exploratory, intrinsically motivated agents or robots, encouraging them to provoke event sequences exhibiting previously unknown but learnable algorithmic regularities. Emphasis is put on the importance of limited computational resources for online prediction and compression. Discrete and continuous time formulations are given. Previous practical but non-optimal implementations (1991, 1995, 1997-2002) are reviewed, as well as several recent variants by others (2005-).

	Abstract = {Brain stimulation is having remarkable impact on clinical neurology. Brain stimulation can modulate neuronal activity in functionally segregated circumscribed regions of the human brain. Polarity, frequency, and noise specific stimulation can induce specific manipulations on neural activity. In contrast to neocortical stimulation, deep-brain stimulation has become a tool that can dramatically improve the impact clinicians can possibly have on movement disorders. In contrast, neocortical brain stimulation is proving to be remarkably susceptible to intrinsic brain-states. Although evidence is accumulating that brain stimulation can facilitate recovery processes in patients with cerebral stroke, the high variability of results impedes successful clinical implementation. Interestingly, recent data in healthy subjects suggests that brain-state dependent patterned stimulation might help resolve some of the intrinsic variability found in previous studies. In parallel, other studies suggest that noisy ``stochastic resonance'' (SR)-like processes are a non-negligible component in non-invasive brain stimulation studies. The hypothesis developed in this manuscript is that stimulation patterning with noisy and oscillatory components will help patients recover from stroke related deficits more reliably. To address this hypothesis we focus on two factors common to both neural computation (intrinsic variables) as well as brain stimulation (extrinsic variables): noise and oscillation. We review diverse theoretical and experimental evidence that demonstrates that subject-function specific brain-states are associated with specific oscillatory activity patterns. These states are transient and can be maintained by noisy processes. The resulting control procedures can resemble homeostatic or SR processes. In this context we try to extend awareness for inter-individual differences and the use of individualized stimulation in the recovery maximization of stroke patients.},

However, population features such as the inherent variability in dendritic morphology between cells belonging to the same neuronal type are often overlooked when studying computation in neural networks. While detailed models for morphology and electrophysiology exist for many types of single neurons, the role of detailed single cell morphology in the population has not been studied quantitatively or computationally. Here we use the structural context of the neural tissue in which dendritic trees exist to drive their generation in silico. We synthesize the entire population of dentate gyrus granule cells, the most numerous cell type in the hippocampus, by growing their dendritic trees within their characteristic dendritic fields bounded by the realistic structural context of (1) the granule cell layer that contains all somata and (2) the molecular layer that contains the dendritic forest. This process enables branching statistics to be linked to larger scale neuroanatomical features. We find large differences in dendritic total length and individual path length measures as a function of location in the dentate gyrus and of somatic depth in the granule cell layer. We also predict the number of unique granule cell dendrites invading a given volume in the molecular layer. This work enables the complete population-level study of morphological properties and provides a framework to develop complex and realistic neural network models.},

We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks. Finally, we develop a mean field theory for backpropagation and we show that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradient respectively.},

In this paper we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesise that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of the ventral pathway, dedicated to vision for perception and dorsal pathway, dedicated to vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task and apply it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two unrelated tasks using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to reason about the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond as we predict that the degree to which tasks are related is a good descriptor of the degree to which they can share downstream corticalunits.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a ``surrogate'' objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD({$\lambda$}). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks.},

	Abstract = {Summary The nervous system faces an extremely difficult task. It must be flexible, both during development and in adult life, so that it can respond to a variety of environmental demands and produce adaptive behavior. At the same time the nervous system must be stable, so that the neural circuits that produce behavior function throughout the lifetime of the animal and that changes produced by learning endure. We are only beginning to understand how neural networks strike a balance between altering individual neurons in the name of plasticity, while maintaining long-term stability in neural system function. The balance of this plasticity and stability in neural networks undoubtedly plays a critical role in the normal functioning of the nervous system. While mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have garnered extensive study over the past three decades, it is only recently that more attention has been turned to plasticity of intrinsic excitability as a key player in neural network function. This review will focus on this emerging area of research that undoubtedly will contribute a great deal to our understanding of the functionality of the nervous system.},

	Abstract = {How do humans search for rewards? This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We introduce a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an option's spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. The experiments rule out several heuristic explanations, and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Data assimilation is a valuable tool in the study of any complex system, where measurements are incomplete, uncertain, or both. It enables the user to take advantage of all available information including experimental measurements and shortterm model forecasts of a system. Although data assimilation has been used to study other biological systems, the study of the sleep-wake regulatory network has yet to benefit from this toolset. We present a data assimilation framework based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for combining sparse measurements together with a relatively high-dimensional nonlinear computational model to estimate the state of a model of the sleep-wake regulatory system. We demonstrate with simulation studies that a few noisy variables can be used to accurately reconstruct the remaining hidden variables. We introduce a metric for ranking relative partial observability of computational models, within the UKF framework, that allows us to choose the optimal variables for measurement and also provides a methodology for optimizing framework parameters such as UKF covariance inflation. In addition, we demonstrate a parameter estimation method that allows us to track nonstationary model parameters and accommodate slow dynamics not included in the UKF filter model. Finally, we show that we can even use observed discretized sleep-state, which is not one of the model variables, to reconstruct model state and estimate unknown parameters. Sleep is implicated in many neurological disorders from epilepsy to schizophrenia, but simultaneous observation of the many brain components that regulate this behavior is difficult. We anticipate that this data assimilation framework will enable better understanding of the detailed interactions governing sleep and wake behavior and provide for better, more targeted, therapies.},

@article{Seeds2014,
	Abstract = {Motor sequences are formed through the serial execution of different movements, but how nervous systems implement this process remains largely unknown. We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel, but selected serially through hierarchical suppression, was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.
          , 
            Anyone who has ever lived with a cat is familiar with its grooming behavior. This innate behavior follows a particular sequence as the cat methodically cleans its body parts one-by-one. Many animals also have grooming habits, even insects such as fruit flies. The fact that grooming sequences are seen across such different species suggests that this behavior is important for survival. Nevertheless, how the brain organizes grooming sequences, or other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks, is not well understood.
            Fruit flies make a good model for studying grooming behavior for a couple of reasons. First, they are fastidious cleaners. When coated with dust they will faithfully carry out a series of cleaning tasks to clean each body part. Second, there are many genetic tools and techniques that researchers can use to manipulate the fruit flies' behaviors. One technique allows specific brain cells to be targeted and activated to trigger particular behaviors.
            Seeds et al. used these sophisticated techniques, computer modeling, and behavioral observations to uncover how the brains of fruit flies orchestrate a grooming sequence. Dust-covered flies follow a predictable sequence of cleaning tasks: beginning by using their front legs to clean their eyes, they then clean their antennae and head. This likely helps to protect their sensory organs. Next, they move on to the abdomen, possibly to ensure that dust doesn't interfere with their ability to breathe. Wings and thorax follow last. Periodically, the flies stop to rub their legs together to remove any accumulated dust before resuming the cleaning sequence.
            Seeds et al. activated different sets of brain cells one-by-one to see if they could trigger a particular grooming task and found that individual cleaning tasks could be triggered, in the absence of dust, by stimulating a specific group of brain cells. This suggests each cleaning task is a discrete behavior controlled by a subset of cells. Then Seeds et al. tried to stimulate more than one cleaning behavior at a time; they discovered that wing-cleaning suppressed thorax-cleaning, abdomen-cleaning suppressed both of these, and head-cleaning suppressed all the others. This suggests that a `hierarchy' exists in the brain that exactly matches the sequence that flies normally follow as they clean their body parts.
            By learning more about how the brain coordinates grooming sequences, the findings of Seeds et al. may also provide insights into other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks, such as nest building in animals or typing in humans. Following on from this work, one of the next challenges will be to see if such behaviors also use a `suppression hierarchy' to ensure that individual tasks are carried out in the right order.},

	Abstract = {We derive an instantaneous (per-round) data-dependent regret bound for stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (also known as contextual bandits). The scaling of our regret bound with the number of states (contexts) N goes as pN I{$\dashrightarrow$} (S; A), where I{$\dashrightarrow$} (S; A) is the mutual information between states and act t tions (the side information) used by the algorithm at roupnd t. If the algorithm uses all the side information, the regret bound scales as N ln K, where K is the number of actions (arms). However, if the side information I{$\dashrightarrow$} (S; A) is not t fully used, the regret bound is significantly tighter. In the extreme case, when I{$\dashrightarrow$} (S; A) = 0, the dependence on the number of states reduces from linear to t logarithmic. Our analysis allows to provide the algorithm large amount of side information, let the algorithm to decide which side information is relevant for the task, and penalize the algorithm only for the side information that it is using de facto. We also present an algorithm for multiarmed bandits with side information with O(K) computational complexity per game round.},

	Abstract = {Working memory (WM) involves maintaining information in an on-line state. One emerging view is that information in WM is maintained via sensory recruitment, such that information is stored via sustained activity in the sensory areas that encode the to-be-remembered information. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed that key sensory regions such as primary visual cortex (V1) showed little evidence of sustained increases in mean activation during a WM delay period, though such amplitude increases have typically been used to determine whether a region is involved in on-line maintenance. However, a multivoxel pattern analysis of delay-period activity revealed a sustained pattern of activation in V1 that represented only the intentionally stored feature of a multifeature object. Moreover, the pattern of delay activity was qualitatively similar to that observed during the discrimination of sensory stimuli, suggesting that WM representations in V1 are reasonable ``copies'' of those evoked during pure sensory processing.},

	Abstract = {Gain control is essential for the proper function of any sensory system. However, the precise mechanisms for achieving effective gain control in the brain are unknown. Based on our understanding of the existence and strength of connections in the insect olfactory system, we analyze the conditions that lead to controlled gain in a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We consider two scenarios for the variation of input into the system. In the first case, the intensity of the sensory input controls the input currents to a fixed proportion of neurons of the excitatory and inhibitory populations. In the second case, increasing intensity of the sensory stimulus will both, recruit an increasing number of neurons that receive input and change the input current that they receive. Using a mean field approximation for the network activity we derive relationships between the parameters of the network that ensure that the overall level of activity of the excitatory population remains unchanged for increasing intensity of the external stimulation. We find that, first, the main parameters that regulate network gain are the probabilities of connections from the inhibitory population to the excitatory population and of the connections within the inhibitory population. Second, we show that strict gain control is not achievable in a random network in the second case, when the input recruits an increasing number of neurons. Finally, we confirm that the gain control conditions derived from the mean field approximation are valid in simulations of firing rate models and Hodgkin-Huxley conductance based models.},

	Abstract = {It is well-known that chemical synaptic transmission is an unreliable process, but the function of such unreliability remains unclear. Here I consider the hypothesis that the randomness of synaptic transmission is harnessed by the brain for learning, in analogy to the way that genetic mutation is utilized by Darwinian evolution. This is possible if synapses are ``hedonistic,'' responding to a global reward signal by increasing their probabilities of vesicle release or failure, depending on which action immediately preceded reward. Hedonistic synapses learn by computing a stochastic approximation to the gradient of the average reward. They are compatible with synaptic dynamics such as short-term facilitation and depression and with the intricacies of dendritic integration and action potential generation. A network of hedonistic synapses can be trained to perform a desired computation by administering reward appropriately, as illustrated here through numerical simulations of integrate-andfire model neurons.},

	Abstract = {Most natural domains can be represented in multiple ways: we can categorize foods in terms of their nutritional content or social role, animals in terms of their taxonomic groupings or their ecological niches, and musical instruments in terms of their taxonomic categories or social uses. Previous approaches to modeling human categorization have largely ignored the problem of cross-categorization, focusing on learning just a single system of categories that explains all of the features. Cross-categorization presents a difficult problem: how can we infer categories without first knowing which features the categories are meant to explain? We present a novel model that suggests that human cross-categorization is a result of joint inference about multiple systems of categories and the features that they explain. We also formalize two commonly proposed alternative explanations for cross-categorization behavior: a features-first and an objects-first approach. The features-first approach suggests that cross-categorization is a consequence of attentional processes, where features are selected by an attentional mechanism first and categories are derived second. The objects-first approach suggests that cross-categorization is a consequence of repeated, sequential attempts to explain features, where categories are derived first, then features that are poorly explained are recategorized. We present two sets of simulations and experiments testing the models' predictions about human categorization. We find that an approach based on joint inference provides the best fit to human categorization behavior, and we suggest that a full account of human category learning will need to incorporate something akin to these capabilities.},

	Abstract = {The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.},

The driver can be identified as the transmitter of receptive field properties; the modulator can be identified as altering the probability of certain aspects of that transmission. Where receptive fields are not available, the distinction is more difficult and currently is undefined. We use the visual pathways, particularly the thalamic geniculate relay for which much relevant evidence is available, to explore ways in which drivers can be distinguished from modulators. The extent to which the distinction may apply first to other parts of the thalamus and then, possibly, to other parts of the brain is considered. We suggest the following distinctions: Crosscorrelograms from driver inputs have sharper peaks than those from modulators; there are likely to be few drivers but many modulators for any one cell; and drivers are likely to act only through ionotropic receptors having a fast postsynaptic effect whereas modulators also are likely to activate metabotropic receptors having a slow and prolonged postsynaptic effect.},

	Abstract = {We show that dynamical gain modulation of neurons' stimulus response is described as an information-theoretic cycle that generates entropy associated with the stimulus-related activity from entropy produced by the modulation. To articulate this theory, we describe stimulus-evoked activity of a neural population based on the maximum entropy principle with constraints on two types of overlapping activities, one that is controlled by stimulus conditions and the other, termed internal activity, that is regulated internally in an organism. We demonstrate that modulation of the internal activity realises gain control of stimulus response, and controls stimulus information. A cycle of neural dynamics is then introduced to model information processing by the neurons during which the stimulus information is dynamically enhanced by the internal gain-modulation mechanism. Based on the conservation law for entropy production, we demonstrate that the cycle generates entropy ascribed to the stimulus-related activity using entropy supplied by the internal mechanism, analogously to a heat engine that produces work from heat. We provide an efficient cycle that achieves the highest entropic efficiency to retain the stimulus information. The theory allows us to quantify efficiency of the internal computation and its theoretical limit.},

First, we examine the commonalities in the internal representation of objects across people at the level of interobject distances, derived from whole brain fMRI data, and second, at the level of spatially localized anatomical brain regions that contain sufficient information for identification of object categories, without making the assumption that their voxel patterns are spatially matched in a common space. We examine the commonalities in internal representation of objects on 3T fMRI data collected while participants viewed line drawings depicting various tools and dwellings.

After tracing a representative sample of the recent literature, we identify four well-defined problems in multi-agent reinforcement learning, single out the problem that in our view is most suitable for AI, and make some remarks about how we believe progress is to be made on this problem.},

@article{Shouval2002,
	Abstract = {Different mechanisms that could form the molecular basis for bi-directional synaptic plasticity have been identified experimentally and corresponding biophysical models can be constructed. However, such models are complex and therefore it is hard to deduce their consequences to compare them to existing abstract models of synaptic plasticity. In this paper we examine two such models: a phenomenological one inspired by the phenomena of AMPA receptor insertion, and a more complex biophysical model based on the phenomena of AMPA receptor phosphorylation. We show that under certain approximations both these models can be mapped on to an equivalent, calcium-dependent, differential equation. Intracellular calcium concentration varies locally in each postsynaptic compartment, thus the plasticity rule we extract is a single-synapse rule. We convert this single synapse plasticity equation to a multisynapse rule by incorporating a model of the NMDA receptor. Finally we suggest a mathematical embodiment of metaplasticity, which is consistent with observations on NMDA receptor properties and dependence on cellular activity. These results, in combination with some of our previous results, produce converging evidence for the calcium control hypothesis including a dependence of synaptic plasticity on the level of intercellular calcium as well as on the temporal pattern of calcium transients.},

	Abstract = {Efficient exploration is an unsolved problem in Reinforcement Learning which is usually addressed by reactively rewarding the agent for fortuitously encountering novel situations. This paper introduces an efficient active exploration algorithm, Model-Based Active eXploration (MAX), which uses an ensemble of forward models to plan to observe novel events. This is carried out by optimizing agent behaviour with respect to a measure of novelty derived from the Bayesian perspective of exploration, which is estimated using the disagreement between the futures predicted by the ensemble members. We show empirically that in semi-random discrete environments where directed exploration is critical to make progress, MAX is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than strong baselines. MAX scales to highdimensional continuous environments where it builds task-agnostic models that can be used for any downstream task.},

We study a computer-simulated multicompartment model neuron In which channel density depends on local Ca2+ concentrations.

Here we discuss recent studies that have instead investigated the interactions between brain regions during cognitive processes by assessing correlations between neuronal oscillations in different regions of the primate cerebral cortex. These studies have opened a new window onto the large-scale circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor decision-making and top-down attention. We propose that frequency-specific neuronal correlations in large-scale cortical networks may be `fingerprints' of canonical neuronal computations underlying cognitive processes.},

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

@article{Sims2016,
	Abstract = {The fundamental goal of perception is to aid in the achievement of behavioral objectives. This requires extracting and communicating useful information from noisy and uncertain sensory signals. At the same time, given the complexity of sensory information and the limitations of biological information processing, it is necessary that some information must be lost or discarded in the act of perception. Under these circumstances, what constitutes an `optimal' perceptual system? This paper describes the mathematical framework of rate\textendash{}distortion theory as the optimal solution to the problem of minimizing the costs of perceptual error subject to strong constraints on the ability to communicate or transmit information. Rate\textendash{}distortion theory offers a general and principled theoretical framework for developing computational-level models of human perception (Marr, 1982). Models developed in this framework are capable of producing quantitatively precise explanations for human perceptual performance, while yielding new insights regarding the nature and goals of perception. This paper demonstrates the application of rate\textendash{}distortion theory to two benchmark domains where capacity limits are especially salient in human perception: discrete categorization of stimuli (also known as absolute identification) and visual working memory. A software package written for the R statistical programming language is described that aids in the development of models based on rate\textendash{}distortion theory.},

	Abstract = {Recent "connectionist" models provide a new explanatory alternative to the digital computer as a model for brain function. Evidence from our EEG research on the olfactory bulb suggests that the brain may indeed use computational mechanisms like those found in connectionist models. In the present paper we discuss our data and develop a model to describe the neural dynamics responsible for odor recognition and discrimination. The results indicate the existence of sensory- and motor-specific information in the spatial dimension of EEG activity and call for new physiological metaphors and techniques of analysis. Special emphasis is placed in our model on chaotic neural activity. We hypothesize that chaotic behavior serves as the essential ground state for the neural perceptual apparatus, and we propose a mechanism for acquiring new forms of patterned activity corresponding to new learned odors. Finally, some of the implications of our neural model for behavioral theories are briefly discussed. Our research, in concert with the connectionist work, encourages a reevaluation of explanatory models that are based only on the digital computer metaphor.},

	Abstract = {Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is proving very powerful in the analysis of fMRI timeseries data, yielding surprising sensitivity, in many different contexts, to the response characteristics of neurons in a given brain region. However, MVPA yields a metric (classification performance) that does not readily lend itself to quantitative comparisons across experimental conditions, brain regions or people. This is because performance is influenced by a number of factors other than the sensitivity of neurons to the experimental manipulation. One such factor that varies widely but has been largely ignored in MVPA studies is the amplitude of the response being decoded. In a noisy system, it is expected that measured classification performance will decline with declining response amplitude, even if the underlying neuronal specificity is constant. We document the relationship between response amplitude and classification performance in the context of orientation decoding in the visual cortex. Flickering sine gratings were presented at each of two orthogonal orientations in a block design (multivariate experiment) or an event-related design (univariate experiment). Response amplitude was manipulated by varying stimulus contrast. Orientation classification performance in retinotopically defined occipital area V1 increased approximately linearly with the logarithm of stimulus contrast. As expected, univariate response amplitude also increased with contrast. Similar results were obtained in V2, V3 and V3A. Plotting classification performance against response amplitude gave a function with a compressive non-linearity that was well fit by a power function. Knowledge of this function potentially allows adjustment of classification performance to take account of the effect of response size, making comparisons across brain areas, categories or people more meaningful.},

Prototypical networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend prototypical networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-theart results on the CU-Birds dataset.},

	Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesioning are two surgical techniques used in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients whose symptoms are not well controlled by drugs, or who experience dyskinesias as a side effect of medications. Although these treatments have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS and lesioning are still not well understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) are two common targets for both DBS and lesioning. Previous studies have indicated that DBS not only affects local cells within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring regions. Using a computational model of the basal ganglia-thalamic network, we studied the relative contributions of activation and silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of passage (FOPs) to changes in the accuracy of information transmission through the thalamus (thalamic fidelity), which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS. Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-DBS were beneficial to the outcome of stimulation. During STN and GPi lesioning, effects of silencing LCs and FOPs were different between the two types of lesioning. For STN lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to its effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not improve thalamic fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi lesioning contributed to improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus, two distinct mechanisms produced comparable improvements in thalamic function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic inhibition and silencing the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition. These results show the importance of considering effects of activating or silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus when deciding upon a target location for DBS or lesioning.},

	Abstract = {Statistical regularities in the environment create prior beliefs that we rely on to optimize our behavior when sensory information is uncertain. Bayesian theory formalizes how prior beliefs can be leveraged and has had a major impact on models of perception, sensorimotor function, and cognition. However, it is not known how recurrent interactions among neurons mediate Bayesian integration. By using a timeinterval reproduction task in monkeys, we found that prior statistics warp neural representations in the frontal cortex, allowing the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs to incorporate prior statistics in accordance with Bayesian inference. Analysis of recurrent neural network models performing the task revealed that this warping was enabled by a low-dimensional curved manifold and allowed us to further probe the potential causal underpinnings of this computational strategy. These results uncover a simple and general principle whereby prior beliefs exert their influence on behavior by sculpting cortical latent dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Interactions between the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia form the basis of cognitive information processing in the mammalian brain. Understanding the principles of neuroanatomical organization in these structures is critical to understanding the functions they perform and ultimately how the human brain works. We have manually distilled and synthesized hundreds of primate neuroanatomy facts into a single interactive visualization. The resulting picture represents the fundamental neuroanatomical blueprint upon which cognitive functions must be implemented. Within this framework we hypothesize and detail 7 functional circuits corresponding to psychological perspectives on the brain: consolidated long-term declarative memory, short-term declarative memory, working memory/information processing, behavioral memory selection, behavioral memory output, cognitive control, and cortical information flow regulation. Each circuit is described in terms of distinguishable neuronal groups including the cerebral isocortex (9 pyramidal neuronal groups), parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, thalamus (4 neuronal groups), basal ganglia (7 neuronal groups), metencephalon, basal forebrain, and other subcortical nuclei. We focus on neuroanatomy related to primate nonprimary cortical systems to elucidate the basis underlying the distinct homotypical cognitive architecture. To display the breadth of this review, we introduce a novel method of integrating and presenting data in multiple independent visualizations: an interactive website (http://www.frontiersin.org/files/cognitiveconsilience/index.html) and standalone iPhone and iPad applications. With these tools we present a unique, annotated view of neuroanatomical consilience (integration of knowledge).},

	Abstract = {Neural conditioning associates cues and actions with following rewards. The environments in which robots operate, however, are pervaded by a variety of disturbing stimuli and uncertain timing. In particular, variable reward delays make it difficult to reconstruct which previous actions are responsible for following rewards. Such an uncertainty is handled by biological neural networks, but represents a challenge for computational models, suggesting the lack of a satisfactory theory for robotic neural conditioning. The present study demonstrates the use of rare neural correlations in making correct associations between rewards and previous cues or actions. Rare correlations are functional in selecting sparse synapses to be eligible for later weight updates if a reward occurs. The repetition of this process singles out the associating and reward-triggering pathways, and thereby copes with distal rewards. The neural network displays macro-level classical and operant conditioning, which is demonstrated in an interactive real-life human-robot interaction. The proposed mechanism models realistic conditioning in humans and animals and implements similar behaviors in neuro-robotic platforms.},

	Abstract = {Trained neural network models, which exhibit many features observed in neural recordings from behaving animals and whose activity and connectivity can be fully analyzed, may provide insights into neural mechanisms. In contrast to commonly used methods for supervised learning from graded error signals, however, animals learn from reward feedback on definite actions through reinforcement learning. Reward maximization is particularly relevant when the optimal behavior depends on an animal's internal judgment of confidence or subjective preferences. Here, we describe reward-based training of recurrent neural networks in which a value network guides learning by using the selected actions and activity of the policy network to predict future reward. We show that such models capture both behavioral and electrophysiological findings from well-known experimental paradigms. Our results provide a unified framework for investigating diverse cognitive and value-based computations, including a role for value representation that is essential for learning, but not executing, a task.},

	Abstract = {Although resting-state functional connectivity is a commonly used neuroimaging paradigm, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits generate oscillations at different frequencies during spontaneous activity. However, it remains unclear how the various rhythms interact and whether their interactions are lamina-specific. Here we investigated intra- and inter-laminar spontaneous phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). We recorded local-field potentials using laminar probes inserted in the forelimb representation of rat area S1. We then computed time-series of frequency-band- and lamina-specific current source density (CSD), and PACs of CSD for all possible pairs of the classical frequency bands in the range of 1\textendash{}150 Hz. We observed both intra- and inter-laminar spontaneous PAC. Of 18 possible combinations, 12 showed PAC, with the highest measures of interaction obtained for the pairs of the theta/gamma and delta/gamma bands. Intra- and inter-laminar PACs involving layers 2/3\textendash{}5a were higher than those involving layer 6. Current sinks (sources) in the delta band were associated with increased (decreased) amplitudes of high-frequency signals in the beta to fast gamma bands throughout layers 2/3\textendash{}6. Spontaneous sinks (sources) of the theta and alpha bands in layers 2/3\textendash{}4 were on average linked to dipoles completed by sources (sinks) in layer 6, associated with high (low) amplitudes of the beta to fast-gamma bands in the entire cortical column. Our findings show that during spontaneous activity, delta, theta, and alpha oscillations are associated with periodic excitability, which for the theta and alpha bands is lamina-dependent. They further emphasize the differences between the function of layer 6 and that of the superficial layers, and the role of layer 6 in controlling activity in those layers. Our study links theories on the involvement of PAC in resting-state functional connectivity with previous work that revealed lamina-specific anatomical thalamo-cortico-cortical connections.},

	Abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), the phenomenon where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency, is becoming an important neurophysiological indicator of short- and long-range information transmission in the brain. Although recent evidence suggests that PAC might play a functional role during sensorimotor, and cognitive events, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain imprecise. Thus, a realistic but simple enough computational model of the phenomenon is needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6). While experimental studies often focus in only one or two PAC combinations (e.g., theta-gamma or alpha-gamma) our simulations show that the cortical column can generate almost all possible couplings of phases and amplitudes, which are influenced by connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that the effective connectivity between neuronal populations can result in the emergence of PAC combinations with frequencies different from the natural frequencies of the oscillators involved. For instance, simulations of oscillators with natural frequencies in the theta, alpha and gamma bands, were able to produce significant PAC combinations involving delta and beta bands.},

	Abstract = {Feedforward neural networks provide the dominant model of how the brain performs visual object recognition. However, these networks lack the lateral and feedback connections, and the resulting recurrent neuronal dynamics, of the ventral visual pathway in the human and nonhuman primate brain. Here we investigate recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections. Combining these types of connections yields four architectures (B, BT, BL, and BLT), which we systematically test and compare. We hypothesized that recurrent dynamics might improve recognition performance in the challenging scenario of partial occlusion. We introduce two novel occluded object recognition tasks to test the efficacy of the models, digit clutter (where multiple target digits occlude one another) and digit debris (where target digits are occluded by digit fragments). We find that recurrent neural networks outperform feedforward control models (approximately matched in parametric complexity) at recognising objects, both in the absence of occlusion and in all occlusion conditions. Recurrent networks were also found to be more robust to the inclusion of additive Gaussian noise. Recurrent neural networks are better in two respects: (1) they are more neurobiologically realistic than their feedforward counterparts; (2) they are better in terms of their ability to recognise objects, especially under challenging conditions. This work shows that computer vision can benefit from using recurrent convolutional architectures and suggests that the ubiquitous recurrent connections in biological brains are essential for task performance.},

	Abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ``thinned'' networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

Although VTA dopaminergic neurons reciprocally project to the LHb, the electrophysiological properties and the behavioral consequences associated with selective manipulations of this circuit are unknown. Here, we identify an inhibitory input to the LHb arising from a unique population of VTA neurons expressing dopaminergic markers. Optogenetic activation of this circuit resulted in no detectable dopamine release in LHb brain slices. Instead, stimulation produced GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission, which suppressed the firing of postsynaptic LHb neurons in brain slices and increased the spontaneous firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo activation of this pathway produced reward-related phenotypes that were dependent on intra-LHb GABAA receptor signaling. These results suggest that noncanonical inhibitory signaling by these hybrid dopaminergic-GABAergic neurons act to suppress LHb output under rewarding conditions.},

We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

The task activated 60\% of the neurons, involving nearly all 42 recorded brain regions, well beyond the regions activated by passive visual stimulation. However, neurons selective for choice (left vs. right) were rare, and found mostly in midbrain, striatum, and frontal cortex. Those in midbrain were typically activated prior to contralateral choices and suppressed prior to ipsilateral choices, consistent with a competitive midbrain circuit for adjudicating the subject's choice. A brain-wide state shift distinguished trials in which visual stimuli led to movement.

	Abstract = {Background: Although the basal ganglia are thought to play a key role in action selection in mammals, it is unknown whether this mammalian circuitry is present in lower vertebrates as a conserved selection mechanism. We aim here, using lamprey, to elucidate the basal ganglia circuitry in the phylogenetically oldest group of vertebrates (cyclostomes) and determine how this selection architecture evolved to accommodate the increased behavioral repertoires of advanced vertebrates.
Results: We show, using immunohistochemistry, tract tracing, and whole-cell recordings, that all parts of the mammalian basal ganglia (striatum, globus pallidus interna [GPi] and externa [GPe], and subthalamic nucleus [STN]) are present in the lamprey forebrain. In addition, the circuit features, molecular markers, and physiological activity patterns are conserved. Thus, GABAergic striatal neurons expressing substance P project directly to the pallidal output layer, whereas enkephalin-expressing striatal neurons project indirectly via nuclei homologous to the GPe and STN. Moreover, pallidal output neurons tonically inhibit tectum, mesencephalic, and diencephalic motor regions.
Conclusions: These results show that the detailed basal ganglia circuitry is present in the phylogenetically oldest vertebrates and has been conserved, most likely as a mechanism for action selection used by all vertebrates, for over 560 million years. Our data also suggest that the mammalian basal ganglia evolved through a process of exaptation, where the ancestral core unit has been co-opted for multiple functions, allowing them to process cognitive, emotional, and motor information in parallel and control a broader range of behaviors.},

The phase response curve (PRC) is a measure of the spike time shift caused by perturbations of the membrane potential as a function of the phase of the spike cycle of a neuron. Near the rheobase, purely positive (type I) phase-response curves are associated with an onset of repetitive firing through a saddle-node bifurcation, whereas biphasic (type II) phase-response curves point towards a transition based on a Hopf-Andronov bifurcation. In recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices, cholinergic action, consistent with down-regulation of slow voltage-dependent potassium currents such as the M-current, switched the PRC from type II to type I. This is the first report showing that cholinergic neuromodulation may cause a qualitative switch in the PRCs type implying a change in the fundamental dynamical mechanism of spike generation.},

The remaining nonpredictive information reflects model complexity that does not improve predictive power, and thus represents the ineffectiveness of the model. We expose the fundamental equivalence between this model inefficiency and thermodynamic inefficiency, measured by dissipation. Our results hold arbitrarily far from thermodynamic equilibrium and are applicable to a wide range of systems, including biomolecular machines.

A full specification of such a network model includes a description of the dynamics and state changes of neurons and synapses, as well as the synaptic connectivity patterns and the initial values of all parameters. A standard approach in neuronal modeling software is to build network models based on a library of pre-defined components and mechanisms; if a model component does not yet exist, it has to be defined in a special-purpose or general low-level language and potentially be compiled and linked with the simulator. Here we propose an alternative approach that allows flexible definition of models by writing textual descriptions based on mathematical notation. We demonstrate that this approach allows the definition of a wide range of models with minimal syntax. Furthermore, such explicit model descriptions allow the generation of executable code for various target languages and devices, since the description is not tied to an implementation. Finally, this approach also has advantages for readability and reproducibility, because the model description is fully explicit, and because it can be automatically parsed and transformed into formatted descriptions. The presented approach has been implemented in the Brian2 simulator.},

	Abstract = {Despite compelling evidence that glial cells could crucially regulate neural network activity, the vast majority of available neural simulators ignores the possible contribution of glia to neuronal physiology. Here, we show how to model glial physiology and neuron-glia interactions in the Brian 2 simulator. Brian 2 offers facilities to explicitly describe any model in mathematical terms with limited and simple simulator-specific syntax, automatically generating high-performance code from the user-provided descriptions. The flexibility of this approach allows us to model not only networks of neurons, but also individual glial cells, electrical coupling of glial cells, and the interaction between glial cells and synapses. We therefore conclude that Brian 2 provides an ideal platform to efficiently simulate glial physiology, and specifically, the influence of astrocytes on neural activity.},

	Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate frequency, severity, and correlation of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) with motor complications in fluctuating Parkinson disease (PD).
Methods: The Multicenter NonMotor Fluctuations in PD cross-sectional study used clinical examination of 10 NMS (dysphagia, anxiety, depression, fatigue, excessive sweating, inner restlessness, pain, concentration/attention, dizziness, bladder urgency) quantified using a visual analogue scale (VAS) in motor-defined on (NMSOn) and off state (NMSOff) combined with motor assessments and self-ratings at home in 100 patients with advanced PD.
Results: All NMS except dysphagia, excessive sweating, and bladder urgency fluctuated in conjunction to motor fluctuations with more frequent and severe symptoms in off compared to on state. The proportions of patients experiencing autonomic/sensory NMS in both motor states were similar to those with these NMS exclusively in off state (ratios 0.4\textendash{}1.3), while for mental/psychic NMS the proportions with exclusive manifestation in off state were higher (ratios 1.8\textendash{}3.1). Demographic and clinical characteristics correlated neither with NMS frequency patterns and severities nor with DNMSOn/Off severities (defined as the differences of VAS scores between on and off). Severities of NMSon, NMSOff, and DNMSOn/Off did not correlate with motor function. Presence of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain had negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire\textendash{}8 scoring independent of their occurrence with respect to motor state. Fluctuations of these NMS but not of fatigue deteriorated HRQOL.
Conclusion: Patterns of NMS fluctuations are heterogeneous and complex, but psychic NMS fluctuate more frequently and severely. Demographic parameters and motor function do not correlate with NMS or nonmotor fluctuation severities in fluctuating PD. Neurology{\^a} 2013;80:800\textendash{}809},

To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model accurately reproduced the wide variety of activity patterns in our recordings, and analysis of its parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory interneurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate the power of fitting spiking network models directly to multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs by controlling network stability.},

	Abstract = {Lossy compression and clustering fundamentally involve a decision about what features are relevant and which are not. The information bottleneck method (IB) by Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek formalized this notion as an information-theoretic optimization problem and proposed an optimal tradeoff between throwing away as many bits as possible, and selectively keeping those that are most important. In the IB, compression is measure my mutual information. Here, we introduce an alternative formulation that replaces mutual information with entropy, which we call the deterministic information bottleneck (DIB), that we argue better captures this notion of compression. As suggested by its name, the solution to the DIB problem turns out to be a deterministic encoder, or hard clustering, as opposed to the stochastic encoder, or soft clustering, that is optimal under the IB. We compare the IB and DIB on synthetic data, showing that the IB and DIB perform similarly in terms of the IB cost function, but that the DIB significantly outperforms the IB in terms of the DIB cost function. We also empirically find that the DIB offers a considerable gain in computational efficiency over the IB, over a range of convergence parameters. Our derivation of the DIB also suggests a method for continuously interpolating between the soft clustering of the IB and the hard clustering of the DIB.},

@article{Such,
	Abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of techniques that have been developed in the neuroevolution community to improve performance on RL problems. To demonstrate the latter, we show that combining DNNs with novelty search, which was designed to encourage exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA parallelizes better than ES, A3C, and DQN, and enables a state-of-the-art compact encoding technique that can represent million-parameter DNNs in thousands of bytes.},

@article{Sui2009,
	Abstract = {Extraction of relevant features from multitask functional MRI (fMRI) data in order to identify potential biomarkers for disease, is an attractive goal. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature-based framework, which is sensitive and accurate in detecting group differences (e.g. controls vs. patients) by proposing three key ideas. First, we integrate two goal-directed techniques: coefficient-constrained independent component analysis (CC-ICA) and principal component analysis with reference (PCA-R), both of which improve sensitivity to group differences. Secondly, an automated artifact-removal method is developed for selecting components of interest derived from CC-ICA, with an average accuracy of 91\%. Finally, we propose a strategy for optimal feature/component selection, aiming to identify optimal group-discriminative brain networks as well as the tasks within which these circuits are engaged. The group-discriminating performance is evaluated on 15 fMRI feature combinations (5 single features and 10 joint features) collected from 28 healthy control subjects and 25 schizophrenia patients. Results show that a feature from a sensorimotor task and a joint feature from a Sternberg working memory (probe) task and an auditory oddball (target) task are the top two feature combinations distinguishing groups. We identified three optimal features that best separate patients from controls, including brain networks consisting of temporal lobe, default mode and occipital lobe circuits, which when grouped together provide improved capability in classifying group membership. The proposed framework provides a general approach for selecting optimal brain networks which may serve as potential biomarkers of several brain diseases and thus has wide applicability in the neuroimaging research community.},

The studies presented here support the hypothesis that human beings' extended childhood pays off in the form of an ability to learn more about changing environments. Across two studies (n = 213), children and adults played a game where they chose among four different cartoon monsters yielding different numbers of star rewards. Adults focused on maximizing reward, while children chose to explore longer, even at the cost of earning fewer stars. As a result, adults won significantly more stars than children did. However, in the `dynamic' version of the task, the rewards given out by the monsters changed halfway through: the monster that had been giving out the fewest stars began giving out the most. Because children continued to explore whereas adults ignored the low-reward monster, children were much more likely than adults to detect the change. This illustrates that while exploration may be costly in the short term, it leads to a more flexible understanding of the world in the long term, particularly when that world is changing.},

	Abstract = {Brain oscillations are increasingly used for understanding complex psychiatric disorders. Gamma (30\textendash{}50 Hz) oscillations have warranted special attention due to their omnipresence in cognitive tasks. For patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), a disease associated with poor cognition, abnormal gamma oscillations have been reported in many experimental paradigms. The goal of this paper is to review the literature on gamma oscillations in SCZ. The review is structured into four sections. First, the functional role, neurobiology, and analysis of brain oscillations, especially gamma oscillations will be outlined. Second, the neurobiological abnormalities of SCZ in relation to gamma oscillations will be reviewed. Third, selected paradigms for investigating irregular gamma oscillations in SCZ will be discussed in detail. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of current findings and potential future research directions will be provided. The reviewed evidence suggests that gamma oscillations are disrupted in SCZ and could account for cognitive disturbances in this disorder. With additional analysis and experimentation, these indices may ultimately serve as endophenotypes that facilitate the development of etiologically based diagnostic methods, foster early identification and treatment, and advance our understanding of the complex genetic mechanisms involved in this disorder.},

We develop a procedure called FORCE learning for modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired activity patterns. FORCE learning works even though the networks we train are spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during learning. Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than generally appreciated.},

Dyna architectures integrate trial-and-error (reinforcement) learning and execution-time planning into a single process operating alternately on the world and on a learned model of the world. In this paper, I present and show results for two Dyna architectures. The Dyna-PI architecture is based on dynamic programming's policy iteration method and can be related to existing AI ideas such as evaluation functions and universal plans (reactive systems). Using a navigation task, results are shown for a simple Dyna-PI system that simultaneously learns by trial and error, learns a world model, and plans optimal routes using the evolving world model. The Dyna-Q architecture is based on Watkins's Q-learning, a new kind of reinforcement learning. Dyna-Q uses a less familiar set of data structures than does Dyna-PI, but is arguably simpler to implement and use. We show that Dyna-Q architectures are easy to adapt for use in changing environments.},

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams's REINFORCE method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy.},

@article{Suzuki2011,
	Abstract = {We report that, in the rat hippocampus, learning leads to a significant increase in extracellular lactate levels that derive from glycogen, an energy reserve selectively localized in astrocytes. Astrocytic glycogen breakdown and lactate release are essential for long-term but not short-term memory formation, and for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength elicited in vivo. Disrupting the expression of the astrocytic lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) or MCT1 causes amnesia, which, like LTP impairment, is rescued by L-lactate but not equicaloric glucose. Disrupting the expression of the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 also leads to amnesia that is unaffected by either L-lactate or glucose, suggesting that lactate import into neurons is necessary for long-term memory. Glycogenolysis and astrocytic lactate transporters are also critical for the induction of molecular changes required for memory formation, including the induction of phospho-CREB, Arc, and phospho-cofilin. We conclude that astrocyte-neuron lactate transport is required for long-term memory formation.},

@article{Tachibana2011,
	Abstract = {Parkinson's disease is characterized by degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, leading to a wide variety of psychomotor dysfunctions. Accumulated evidence suggests that abnormally synchronized oscillations in the basal ganglia contribute to the expression of parkinsonian motor symptoms. However, the mechanism that generates abnormal oscillations in a dopamine-depleted state remains poorly understood. We addressed this question by examining basal ganglia neuronal activity in two 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated parkinsonian monkeys. We found that systemic administration of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA; dopamine precursor) decreased abnormal neuronal oscillations (8\textendash{}15 Hz) in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during the ON state when parkinsonian signs were alleviated and during l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. GPi oscillations and parkinsonian signs were suppressed by silencing of the STN with infusion of muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist). Intrapallidal microinjection of a mixture of 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP; N-methyl-daspartate receptor antagonist) and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX; AMPA {$\fracslash$} kainate receptor antagonist) also decreased the oscillations in the GPi and the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). Neuronal oscillations in the STN were suppressed after intrasubthalamic microinjection of CPP {$\fracslash$} NBQX to block glutamatergic afferents of the STN. The STN oscillations were further reduced by muscimol inactivation of the GPe to block GABAergic inputs from the GPe. These results suggest that, in the dopamine-depleted state, glutamatergic inputs to the STN and reciprocal GPe\textendash{}STN interconnections are both important for the generation and amplification of the oscillatory activity of STN neurons, which is subsequently transmitted to the GPi, thus contributing to the symptomatic expression of Parkinson's disease.},

We show that if the perturbation is small, then the outlier eigenvalues are created next to the outlier eigenvalues of the bounded rank perturbation; but if the perturbation is large, then many more outliers can be created, and their law is governed by the zeroes of a random Laurent series with Gaussian coefficients. On the other hand, these outliers may be eliminated by enforcing a row sum condition on the final matrix.},

To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, we analyzed 12,714 cells from the primary visual cortex (VISp), and 9,035 cells from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) by deep single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), identifying 116 transcriptomic cell types. These two regions represent distant poles of the neocortex and perform distinct functions. We define 50 inhibitory transcriptomic cell types, all of which are shared across both cortical regions. In contrast, 49 of 52 excitatory transcriptomic types were found in either VISp or ALM, with only three present in both. By combining single cell RNA-seq and retrograde labeling, we demonstrate correspondence between excitatory transcriptomic types and their region-specific long-range target specificity. This study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct regions of the mouse cortex.},

Many such computations require previous building of intrinsic world models. Here we show how spiking neural networks may solve these different tasks. Firstly, we derive constraints under which classes of spiking neural networks lend themselves to substrates of powerful general purpose computing. The networks contain dendritic or synaptic nonlinearities and have a constrained connectivity. We then combine such networks with learning rules for outputs or recurrent connections. We show that this allows to learn even difficult benchmark tasks such as the self-sustained generation of desired low-dimensional chaotic dynamics or memory-dependent computations. Furthermore, we show how spiking networks can build models of external world systems and use the acquired knowledge to control them.},

Many real-valued connectionist approaches to learning control realize exploration by randomness in action selection. This might be disadvantageous when costs are assigned to "negative experiences" . The basic idea presented in this paper is to make an agent explore unknown regions in a more directed manner. This is achieved by a so-called competence map, which is trained to predict the controller's accuracy, and is used for guiding exploration. Based on this, a bistable system enables smoothly switching attention between two behaviors - exploration and exploitation - depending on expected costs and knowledge gain.},

	Abstract = {Prominent theories of decision making suggest that the basal ganglia (BG) play a causal role in deliberation between action choices. An alternative hypothesis is that deliberation occurs in cortical regions, while the BG control the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) between committing to a choice versus continuing to deliberate. Here, we test these hypotheses by recording activity in the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus (GPi/GPe) while monkeys perform a task dissociating the process of deliberation, the moment of commitment, and adjustment of the SAT. Our data suggest that unlike premotor and motor cortical regions, pallidal output does not contribute to the process of deliberation but instead provides a time-varying signal that controls the SAT and reflects the growing urgency to commit to a choice. Once a target is selected by cortical regions, GP activity confirms commitment to the decision and invigorates the subsequent movement.},

Spike-timing precision was maintained during feedforward propagation during entrainment. The range of presynaptic firing rates and precision for entrainment was determined. During entrainment the Shannon information of the output spike phase was reduced but the amount of information the neuron transmitted about the synaptic input was increased. We quantify how robust information transmission is against intrinsic neuronal noise. We propose how neurotnodulation, via entrainment, can regulate the information transfer in neocortical networks. 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {A train of action potentials (a spike train) can carry information in both the average firing rate and the pattern of spikes in the train. But can such a spike-pattern code be supported by cortical circuits? Neurons in vitro produce a spike pattern in response to the injection of a fluctuating current. However, cortical neurons in vivo are modulated by local oscillatory neuronal activity and by top-down inputs. In a cortical circuit, precise spike patterns thus reflect the interaction between internally generated activity and sensory information encoded by input spike trains. We review the evidence for precise and reliable spike timing in the cortex and discuss its computational role.},

	Abstract = {In the primate visual cortex, the phase of spikes relative to oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) in the gamma frequency range (30\textendash{}80 Hz) can be shifted by stimulus features such as orientation and thus the phase may carry information about stimulus identity. According to the principle of communication through coherence (CTC), the relative LFP phase between the LFPs in the sending and receiving circuits affects the effectiveness of the transmission. CTC predicts that phase shifting can be used for stimulus selection. We review and investigate phase shifting in models of periodically driven single neurons and compare it with phase shifting in models of cortical networks. In a single neuron, as the driving current is increased, the spike phase varies systematically while the firing rate remains constant. In a network model of reciprocally connected excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) cells phase shifting occurs in response to both injection of constant depolarizing currents and to brief pulses to I cells. These simple models provide an account for phase-shifting observed experimentally and suggest a mechanism for implementing CTC. We discuss how this hypothesis can be tested experimentally using optogenetic techniques.},

	Abstract = {Complex behaviors demand temporal coordination among functionally distinct brain regions. The basal forebrain's afferent and efferent structure suggests a capacity for mediating such coordination. During performance of a selective attention task, synaptic activity in this region was dominated by four amplitude-oscillations temporally organized by the phase of the slowest, a theta rhythm. Further, oscillatory amplitudes were precisely organized by task epoch and a robust input/output transform, from synchronous synaptic activity to spiking rates of basal forebrain neurons, was identified. For many neurons, spiking was temporally organized as phase precessing sequences against theta band field potential oscillations. Remarkably, theta phase precession advanced in parallel to task progression, rather than absolute spatial location or time. Together, the findings reveal a process by which associative brain regions can integrate independent oscillatory inputs and transform them into sequence-specific, rate-coded outputs that are adaptive to the pace with which organisms interact with their environment.},

	Abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal x {$\in$} X as being the information that this signal provides about another signal y {$\in$} Y . Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal x requires more than just predicting y, it also requires specifying which features of X play a role in the prediction. We formalize the problem as that of finding a short code for X that preserves the maximum information about Y . That is, we squeeze the information that X provides about Y through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords X\texttildelow{} . This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure d(x, x\texttildelow{}) emerges from the joint statistics of X and Y . The approach yields an exact set of self-consistent equations for the coding rules X \textrightarrow{} X\texttildelow{} and X\texttildelow{} \textrightarrow{} Y . Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut\textendash{}Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms.},

Traditional ConvNet architectures include pooling layers which reduce computational requirements, introduce invariance and prevent over-training. These benefits of pooling come at the cost of reduced localization accuracy. We introduce a novel architecture which includes an efficient `position refinement' model that is trained to estimate the joint offset location within a small region of the image. This refinement model is jointly trained in cascade with a state-of-the-art ConvNet model [21] to achieve improved accuracy in human joint location estimation.

These models consist of a 4-parameter dynamical system. We provide the full local bifurcation diagram of the members of this class and show that they all present the same bifurcations: an Andronov\textendash{}Hopf bifurcation manifold, a saddle-node bifurcation manifold, a Bogdanov\textendash{}Takens bifurcation, and possibly a Bautin bifurcation, i.e., all codimension two local bifurcations in a two-dimensional phase space except the cusp. Among other global bifurcations, this system shows a saddle homoclinic bifurcation curve. We show how this bifurcation diagram generates the most prominent cortical neuron behaviors.

The interaction of the differential equations with the reset results in a rich and complex dynamical structure.

	Abstract = {In this manuscript we analyze the collective behavior of mean-field limits of large-scale, spatially extended stochastic neuronal networks with delays. Rigorously, the asymptotic regime of such systems is characterized by a very intricate stochastic delayed integro-differential McKean\textendash{}Vlasov equation that remain impenetrable, leaving the stochastic collective dynamics of such networks poorly understood. In order to study these macroscopic dynamics, we analyze networks of firing-rate neurons, i.e. with linear intrinsic dynamics and sigmoidal interactions. In that case, we prove that the solution of the mean-field equation is Gaussian, hence characterized by its two first moments, and that these two quantities satisfy a set of coupled delayed integro-differential equations. These equations are similar to usual neural field equations, and incorporate noise levels as a parameter, allowing analysis of noise-induced transitions. We identify through bifurcation analysis several qualitative transitions due to noise in the mean-field limit. In particular, stabilization of spatially homogeneous solutions, synchronized oscillations, bumps, chaotic dynamics, wave or bump splitting are exhibited and arise from static or dynamic Turing\textendash{}Hopf bifurcations. These surprising phenomena allow further exploring the role of noise in the nervous system. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Critical states are sometimes identified experimentally through power-law statistics or universal scaling functions. We show here that such features naturally emerge from networks in self-sustained irregular regimes away from criticality. In these regimes, statistical physics theory of large interacting systems predict a regime where the nodes have independent and identically distributed dynamics. We thus investigated the statistics of a system in which units are replaced by independent stochastic surrogates, and found the same power-law statistics, indicating that these are not sufficient to establish criticality. We rather suggest that these are universal features of large-scale networks when considered macroscopically. These results put caution on the interpretation of scaling laws found in nature.},

	Abstract = {Alpha oscillations (7-14 Hz) are modulated in response to visual temporal and spatial cues. However, the neural response to alerting cues is less explored, as is how this response is affected by healthy aging. Using scalp EEG, we examined how visual cortical alpha activity relates to working memory performance. Younger (20-30 years) and older (60-70 years) participants were presented with a visual alerting cue uninformative of the position or size of a lateralized working memory array. Older adults showed longer response times overall and reduced accuracy when memory load was high. Older adults had less consistent cue-evoked alpha phase resetting than younger adults, which predicted worse performance. Alpha phase prior to memory array presentation predicted response time, but the relationship between phase and response time was weaker in older adults. These results suggest that changes in alpha phase dynamics, especially prior to presentation of task-relevant stimuli, potentially contribute to age-related cognitive decline.},

This variability has been observed in multiple invertebrate neuronal types, but they do so in a coordinated manner such that their magnitudes are correlated. These conductance correlations are thought to reflect a tight homeostasis of cellular excitability that enhances the robustness and stability of neuronal activity over long stretches of time. Notably, although such ionic current correlations are well documented in invertebrates, they have not been reported in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate with two examples, identified mouse hippocampal granule cells and cholinergic basal forebrain neurons, that ionic current correlations is a ubiquitous phenomenon expressed by a number of species across phyla.},

Neural population analysis often begins by reducing the dimensionality of the data to focus on the patterns most relevant to a given task. A major practical hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing rapidly as the number of neurons measured increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of low-dimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We re-analyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multi-unit threshold crossings in place of sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use.},

@article{Tripathy,
	Abstract = {How neuronal diversity emerges from complex patterns of gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating pooled- and single-cell transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. Using neuroinformatics methods, we compiled a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types with paired gene expression and intrinsic electrophysiological features from publically accessible sources, the largest such collection to date. We identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 physiological parameters. We next trained statistical models to infer cellular features from multivariate gene expression patterns. Such models were predictive of gene-electrophysiological relationships in an independent collection of 12 visual cortex cell types from the Allen Institute, suggesting that these correlations might reflect general principles relating expression patterns to phenotypic diversity across very different cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like Gabrd and Scn1a (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms. Our work highlights the promise and inherent challenges in using cell type-specific transcriptomics to understand the mechanistic origins of neuronal diversity.},

@article{Tripp2016,
	Abstract = {In performance-optimized artificial neural networks, such as convolutional networks, each neuron makes excitatory connections with some of its targets and inhibitory connections with others. In contrast, physiological neurons are typically either excitatory or inhibitory, not both. This is a puzzle, because it seems to constrain computation, and because there are several counter-examples that suggest that it may not be a physiological necessity. Parisien et al. (2008) showed that any mixture of excitatory and inhibitory functional connections could be realized by a purely excitatory projection in parallel with a two-synapse projection through an inhibitory population. They showed that this works well with ratios of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are realistic for the neocortex, suggesting that perhaps the cortex efficiently works around this apparent computational constraint. Extending this work, we show here that mixed excitatory and inhibitory functional connections can also be realized in networks that are dominated by inhibition, such as those of the basal ganglia. Further, we show that the function-approximation capacity of such connections is comparable to that of idealized mixed-weight connections. We also study whether such connections are viable in recurrent networks, and find that such recurrent networks can flexibly exhibit a wide range of dynamics. These results offer a new perspective on computation in the basal ganglia, and also perhaps on inhibitory networks within the cortex.},

However, it remains largely unclear how different neuron types relate to oscillation features. To understand how excitatory and inhibitory neurons in PFC are coordinated by distinct oscillation signatures, we designed a 3-choice auditory discrimination task and used tetrode devices to examine individual PFC neuron activity and ensemble LFP oscillations in task performing mice. We found that PFC neurons and ensemble LFP oscillations exhibited complex sensory evoked responses that are context and task-progression dependent. While both excitatory and inhibitory neurons were transiently modulated at different phases of the task, inhibitory neurons were increasingly recruited as trial progressed compared to excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons in general showed higher spike-field coherence with LFP oscillations than excitatory neurons throughout the task period, first at higher frequencies at the beginning of the task, and then transitioned to lower frequencies in the middle of the task that sustained beyond task completion. Together, our results demonstrate that excitatory and inhibitory neurons selectively engage distinct oscillation dynamics during sensory discrimination in mice.},

The acquired recordings reveal a persistent characteristic beta band peak in the power spectral density function of the Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. This peak is considered to lie at the core of the causality\textendash{}effect relationships of the parkinsonian pathophysiology. Based on LFPs acquired from human subjects during DBS for PD, we constructed a computational model of the basal ganglia on the population level that generates LFPs to identify the critical pathophysiological alterations that lead to the expression of the beta band peak. To this end, we used experimental data reporting that the strengths of the synaptic connections are modified under dopamine depletion. The hypothesis that the altered dopaminergic modulation may affect both the amplitude and the time course of the postsynaptic potentials is validated by the model. The results suggest a pivotal role of both of these parameters to the pathophysiology of PD.},

	Abstract = {Despite growing interest in multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods for fMRI, a major problem remains \textemdash{}that of generating estimates in rapid event-related (ER) designs, where the BOLD responses of temporally adjacent events will overlap. While this problem has been investigated for methods that reduce each event to a single parameter per voxel (Mumford et al., 2012), most of these methods make strong parametric assumptions about the shape of the hemodynamic response, and require exact knowledge of the temporal profile of the underlying neural activity. A second class of methods uses multiple parameters per event (per voxel) to capture temporal information more faithfully. In addition to enabling a more accurate estimate of ER responses, this allows for the extension of the standard classification paradigm into the temporal domain (e.g., Mour{\~a}o-Miranda et al., 2007). However, existing methods in this class were developed for use with block and slow ER data, and there has not yet been an exploration of how to adapt such methods to data collected using rapid ER designs. Here, we demonstrate that the use of multiple parameters preserves or improves classification accuracy, while additionally providing information on the evolution of class discrimination. Additionally, we explore an alternative to the method of Mour{\~a}o-Miranda et al. tailored to use in rapid ER designs that yields equivalent classification accuracies, but is better at unmixing responses to temporally adjacent events.

	Abstract = {Quadratization of biophysical (conductance-based) models having a parabolic-like voltage nullcline in the subthreshold voltage regime refers to the process by which these models are substituted by ``caricature'' models having a strictly parabolic voltage nullcline and a linear nullcline  for the recovery variable. We refer to the latter as quadratic or parabolic models. The parabolic-like and strictly parabolic voltage nullclines coincide at their extrema (minima or maxima) and  are well approximated by each other in vicinities of these extrema whose size depend on the model parameters. Quadratic models are simplified by a change of variables that translates these extrema into the origin of the phase-plane diagram. A further simplification (parameter reduction) can be achieved by nondimensionalizing  the quadratic models. This procedure can be extended to three-dimensional models having a parabolic-cylinder-like shaped voltage nullsurface and to models having time-dependent inputs and synaptic currents.},

In the current paper, we present an update of the status of this hypothesis through summarizing recent results from our laboratory that suggest important new insights regarding the mechanisms, function and relevance of this phenomenon. In the first part, we present recent results derived from animal experiments and mathematical simulations that provide novel explanations and mechanisms for zero and nero-zero phase lag synchronization. In the second part, we shall discuss the role of neural synchrony for expectancy during perceptual organization and its role in conscious experience. This will be followed by evidence that indicates that in addition to supporting conscious cognition, neural synchrony is abnormal in major brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. We conclude this paper with suggestions for further research as well as with critical issues that need to be addressed in future studies.},

	Abstract = {Dendrites integrate inputs in highly non-linear ways, but it is unclear how these non-linearities contribute to the overall input-output transformation of single neurons. Here, we developed statistically principled methods using a hierarchical cascade of linear-nonlinear subunits (hLN) to model the dynamically evolving somatic response of neurons receiving complex spatio-temporal synaptic input patterns. We used the hLN to predict the membrane potential of a detailed biophysical model of a L2/3 pyramidal cell receiving in vivo-like synaptic input and reproducing in vivo dendritic recordings. We found that more than 90\% of the somatic response could be captured by linear integration followed a single global non-linearity. Multiplexing inputs into parallel processing channels could improve prediction accuracy by as much as additional layers of local non-linearities. These results provide a data-driven characterisation of a key building block of cortical circuit computations: dendritic integration and the input-output transformation of single neurons during in vivo-like conditions.},

	Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy with promissory results for the treatment of movement disorders. It delivers electric stimulation via an electrode to a specific target brain region. The spatial extent of neural response to this stimulation is known as volume of tissue activated (VTA). Changes in stimulation parameters that control VTA, such as amplitude, pulse width and electrode configuration can affect the effectiveness of the DBS therapy. In this study, we develop a novel methodology for estimating suitable DBS neuromodulation parameters, from planned VTA, that attempts to maximize the therapeutic effects, and to minimize the adverse effects of DBS. For estimating the continuous outputs (amplitude and pulse width), we use multi-output support vector regression, taking the geometry of the VTA as input space. For estimating the electrode polarity configuration, we perform several classification problems, also using support vector machines from the same input space. Our methodology attains promising results for both the regression setting, and for predicting electrode active contacts and their polarity. Combining biological neural modeling techniques together with machine learning, we introduce a novel area of research where parameters of neuromodulation in DBS can be tuned by manually specifying a desired geometric volume.},

	Abstract = {Research has suggested that short-term memory and working memory (as measured by simple and complex span tasks, respectively) are separate constructs that are differentially related to higher order cognitive abilities. This claim is critically evaluated by reviewing research that has compared simple and complex span tasks in both experimental and correlational studies. In addition, a meta-analysis and re-analyses of key data sets were conducted. The review and analyses suggest that simple and complex span tasks largely measure the same basic subcomponent processes (e.g., rehearsal, maintenance, updating, controlled search) but differ in the extent to which these processes operate in a particular task. These differences largely depend on the extent to which phonological processes are maximized and variability from long list lengths is present. Potential methodological, psychometric, and assessment implications are discussed and a theoretical account of the data is proposed.},

	Abstract = {Rhythms in brain electrical activity are assumed to play a significant role in many cognitive and perceptual processes. It is thus of great value to analyze these rhythms and their mutual relationships in large scale models of cortical regions. In the present work, we modified the neural mass model by Wendling et al. (Eur. J. Neurosci. 15 (2002) 1499\textendash{}1508) by including a new inhibitory self-loop among GABAA,fast interneurons. A theoretical analysis was performed to demonstrate that, thanks to this loop, GABAA,fast interneurons can produce a {$\gamma$} rhythm in the power spectral density (PSD) even without the participation of the other neural populations. Then, the model of a whole cortical region, built upon four interconnected neural populations (pyramidal cells, excitatory, GABAA,slow and GABAA,fast interneurons) was investigated by changing the internal connectivity parameters. Results show that different rhythm combinations ({$\beta$} and {$\gamma$}, {$\alpha$} and {$\gamma$}, or a wide spectrum) can be obtained within the same region by simply altering connectivity values, without the need to change synaptic kinetics. Finally, two or three cortical regions were connected by using different topologies of long range connections. Results show that long-range connections directed from pyramidal neurons to GABAA,fast interneurons are the most efficient to transmit rhythms from one region to another. In this way, PSD with three or four peaks can be obtained using simple connectivity patterns. The model can be of value to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms involved in the generation of {$\gamma$} rhythms and provide a better understanding of cortical EEG spectra.},

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

	Abstract = {Meta-learning, or learning to learn, is the science of systematically observing how different machine learning approaches perform on a wide range of learning tasks, and then learning from this experience, or meta-data, to learn new tasks much faster than otherwise possible. Not only does this dramatically speed up and improve the design of machine learning pipelines or neural architectures, it also allows us to replace hand-engineered algorithms with novel approaches learned in a data-driven way. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the state of the art in this fascinating and continuously evolving field.},

@article{Varma2006,
	Abstract = {Background: Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data.
Results: We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error. The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30\% on 18.5\% of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30\% on 38\% of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions.
Conclusion: We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

@article{Vegue2017,
	Abstract = {The structure in cortical micro-circuits deviates from what would be expected in a purely random network, which has been seen as evidence of clustering. To address this issue we sought to reproduce the non-random features of cortical circuits by considering several distinct classes of network topology, including clustered networks, networks with distance-dependent connectivity and those with broad degree distributions. To our surprise we found that all these qualitatively distinct topologies could account equally well for all reported non-random features, despite being easily distinguishable from one another at the network level. This apparent paradox was a consequence of estimating network properties given only small sample sizes. In other words, networks which differ markedly in their global structure can look quite similar locally. This makes inferring network structure from small sample sizes, a necessity given the technical difficulty inherent in simultaneous intracellular recordings, problematic. We found that a network statistic called the sample degree correlation (SDC) overcomes this difficulty. The SDC depends only on parameters which can be reliably estimated given small sample sizes, and is an accurate fingerprint of every topological family. We applied the SDC criterion to data from rat visual and somatosensory cortex and discovered that the connectivity was not consistent with any of these main topological classes. However, we were able to fit the experimental data with a more general network class, of which all previous topologies were special cases. The resulting network topology could be interpreted as a combination of physical spatial dependence and non-spatial, hierarchical clustering.},

	Abstract = {We introduce FeUdal Networks (FuNs): a novel architecture for hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our approach is inspired by the feudal reinforcement learning proposal of Dayan and Hinton, and gains power and efficacy by decoupling end-to-end learning across multiple levels \textendash{} allowing it to utilise different resolutions of time. Our framework employs a Manager module and a Worker module. The Manager operates at a lower temporal resolution and sets abstract goals which are conveyed to and enacted by the Worker. The Worker generates primitive actions at every tick of the environment. The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits \textendash{} in addition to facilitating very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages the emergence of sub-policies associated with different goals set by the Manager. These properties allow FuN to dramatically outperform a strong baseline agent on tasks that involve long-term credit assignment or memorisation. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed system on a range of tasks from the ATARI suite and also from a 3D DeepMind Lab environment.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforcement learning environment based on the game StarCraft II. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

	Abstract = {Random neural networks are dynamical descriptions of randomly interconnected neural units. These show a phase transition to chaos as a disorder parameter is increased. The microscopic mechanisms underlying this phase transition are unknown, and similarly to spin-glasses, shall be fundamentally related to the behavior of the system. In this Letter we investigate the explosion of complexity arising near that phase transition. We show that the mean number of equilibria undergoes a sharp transition from one equilibrium to a very large number scaling exponentially with the dimension on the system. Near criticality, we compute the exponential rate of divergence, called topological complexity. Strikingly, we show that it behaves exactly as the maximal Lyapunov exponent, a classical measure of dynamical complexity. This relationship unravels a microscopic mechanism leading to chaos which we further demonstrate on a simpler class of disordered systems, suggesting a deep and underexplored link between topological and dynamical complexity.},

	Abstract = {Recent physiological studies of alert primates have revealed cortical neural correlates of key steps in a perceptual decision-making process. To elucidate synaptic mechanisms of decision making, I investigated a biophysically realistic cortical network model for a visual discrimination experiment. In the model, slow recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition produce attractor dynamics that amplify the difference between conflicting inputs and generates a binary choice. The model is shown to account for salient characteristics of the observed decision-correlated neural activity, as well as the animal's psychometric function and reaction times. These results suggest that recurrent excitation mediated by NMDA receptors provides a candidate cellular mechanism for the slow time integration of sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choices in a decision-making neocortical network.},

	Abstract = {In this work we propose a biologically realistic local cortical circuit model (LCCM), based on neural masses, that incorporates important aspects of the functional organization of the brain that have not been covered by previous models: (1) activity dependent plasticity of excitatory synaptic couplings via depleting and recycling of neurotransmitters and (2) realistic interlaminar dynamics via laminar-specific distribution of and connections between neural populations. The potential of the LCCM was demonstrated by accounting for the process of auditory habituation. The model parameters were specified using Bayesian inference. It was found that: (1) besides the major serial excitatory information pathway (layer 4 to layer 2/3 to layer 5/6), there exists a parallel ``short-cut'' pathway (layer 4 to layer 5/6), (2) the excitatory signal flow from the pyramidal cells to the inhibitory interneurons seems to be more intra-laminar while, in contrast, the inhibitory signal flow from inhibitory interneurons to the pyramidal cells seems to be both intra- and inter-laminar, and (3) the habituation rates of the connections are unsymmetrical: forward connections (from layer 4 to layer 2/3) are more strongly habituated than backward connections (from Layer 5/6 to layer 4). Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel features of the LCCM are of crucial importance for mechanistic explanations of brain function. The incorporation of these features into a mass model makes them applicable to modeling based on macroscopic data (like EEG or MEG), which are usually available in human experiments. Our LCCM is therefore a valuable building block for future realistic models of human cognitive function.},

	Abstract = {Many non-human animals show exploratory behaviors. It remains unclear whether any possess human-like curiosity. We previously proposed three criteria for applying the term curiosity to animal behavior: (1) the subject is willing to sacrifice reward to obtain information, (2) the information provides no immediate instrumental or strategic benefit, and (3) the amount the subject is willing to pay depends systematically on the amount of information available. In previous work on information-seeking in animals, information generally predicts upcoming rewards, and animals' decisions may therefore be a byproduct of reinforcement processes. Here we get around this potential confound by taking advantage of macaques' ability to reason counterfactually (that is, about outcomes that could have occurred had the subject chosen differently). Specifically, macaques sacrificed fluid reward to obtain information about counterfactual outcomes. Moreover, their willingness to pay scaled with the information (Shannon entropy) offered by the counterfactual option. These results demonstrate the existence of human-like curiosity in non-human primates according to our criteria, which circumvent several confounds associated with less stringent criteria.},

@article{Waschke2017,
	Abstract = {Humans sometimes do perceive differences where physically there are none. It is thus tenable that perception is susceptible to seemingly random fluctuations in brain activity or ``neural noise''. Here, we demonstrate the potency of both trial-aggregated as well as trial-by-trial measures in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) to characterize neural noise as (i) a trait of individuals of varying age (n = 19; 19\textendash{}74 years), and (ii) a brain state that predicts an individual's impending perceptual decision. Human participants were instructed to discriminate two identical, consecutively presented pure tones. Behaviorally, all participants reported perceiving pitch differences of first versus second tone. Neurally, decisions for the first versus the second tone were preceded by more consistently phase-locked responses to the first tone in the theta (4\textendash{}9 Hz) band at central scalp electrodes. Second, a trial-wise information-theoretic measure quantifying the irregularity of broadband EEG, Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE), prior to stimulus onset allowed to classify a listener's impending decision on this trial. Average entropy not only increased with participants' age, but correlated with previously suggested measures of an altered excitation\textendash{}inhibition balance in the aging brain. Therefore, neural noise is best conceived not only as a state variable that can shape perceptual decisions but moreover can capture trait-like changes with age.},

	Abstract = {Application of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data enables reconstruction and classification of cognitive status from brain activity. However, previous studies using MVPA have extracted information about cognitive status that is experienced simultaneously with fMRI scanning, but not one that will be observed after the scanning. In this study, by focusing on activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), we demonstrate that MVPA on fMRI data is capable of predicting subsequent recognition performance. In this experiment, six runs of fMRI signals were acquired during encoding of phonogram stimuli. In the analysis, using data acquired in runs 1\textendash{}3, we first conducted MVPA-based voxelwise search for the clusters in the MTL whose signals contained the most information about subsequent recognition performance. Next, using the fMRI signals acquired in runs 1\textendash{}3 from the selected clusters, we trained a classifier function in MVPA. Finally, the trained classifier function was applied to fMRI signals acquired in runs 4\textendash{}6. Consequently, we succeeded in predicting the subsequent recognition performance for stimuli studied in runs 4\textendash{}6 with significant accuracy. This accurate prediction suggests that MVPA can extract information that is associated not only with concurrent cognitive status, but also with behavior in the near future.},

We present a new model of motor structure learning, approaching it from the point of view of deep reinforcement learning. Previous work outside of motor control has shown how recurrent neural networks can account for learning-to-learn effects. We leverage this insight to address motor learning, by importing it into the setting of model-based reinforcement learning. We apply the resulting processing architecture to empirical findings from a landmark study of structure learning in targetdirected reaching (Braun et al., 2009), and discuss its implications for a wider range of learning-to-learn phenomena.},

The radial glial cell, a transient embryonic cell type known for its crucial role in neuronal migration, has recently been shown to function as a neuronal progenitor cell and appears to produce most cortical pyramidal neurons. Radial glial cell modulation could thus affect neuron production, neuronal migration, and overall cortical architecture; however, signaling mechanisms among radial glia have not been studied directly. We demonstrate here that calcium waves propagate through radial glial cells in the proliferative cortical ventricular zone (VZ). Radial glial calcium waves occur spontaneously and require connexin hemichannels, P2Y1 ATP receptors, and intracellular IP3-mediated calcium release. Furthermore, we show that wave disruption decreases VZ proliferation during the peak of embryonic neurogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate a radial glial signaling mechanism that may regulate cortical neuronal production.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on high-frequency (gamma band) EEG activity, the most characteristic electrophysiological pattern in focal seizures of human epilepsy. It starts with recent hypotheses about: (i) the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal or neocortical networks in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations; (ii) the nonuniform alteration of GABAergic inhibition in experimental epilepsy (reduced dendritic inhibition and increased somatic inhibition); and (iii) the possible depression of GABAA,fast circuit activity by GABAA,slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In particular, these hypotheses are introduced in a new computational macroscopic model of EEG activity that includes a physiologically relevant fast inhibitory feedback loop. Results show that strikingly realistic activity is produced by the model when compared to real EEG signals recorded with intracerebral electrodes. They show that, in the model, the transition from interictal to fast ictal activity is explained by the impairment of dendritic inhibition.},

	Abstract = {Humans and other animals often show a strong desire to know the uncertain rewards their future has in store, even when they cannot use this information to influence the outcome. However, it is unknown how the brain predicts opportunities to gain information and motivates this information seeking behavior. Here we show that neurons in a network of interconnected subregions of primate anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia predict the moment of gaining information about uncertain rewards. Spontaneous increases in their information prediction signals are followed by gaze shifts toward objects associated with resolving uncertainty, and pharmacologically disrupting this network reduces the motivation to seek information. These findings demonstrate a cortico-basal ganglia mechanism responsible for motivating actions to resolve uncertainty by seeking knowledge about the future.},

	Abstract = {Oscillatory activity is a principal mode of operation in the brain. Despite an intense resurgence of interest in the mechanisms and functions of brain rhythms, methods for the detection and analysis of oscillatory activity in neurophysiological recordings are still highly variable across studies. We recently proposed a method for detecting oscillatory activity from time series data, which we call the BOSC (Better OSCillation detection) method. This method produces systematic, objective, and consistent results across frequencies, brain regions and tasks. It does so by modeling the functional form of the background spectrum by fitting the empirically observed spectrum at the recording site. This minimizes bias in oscillation detection across frequency, region and task. Here we show that the method is also robust to dramatic changes in state that are known to influence the shape of the power spectrum, namely, the presence versus absence of the alpha rhythm, and can be applied to independent components, which are thought to reflect underlying sources, in addition to individual raw signals. This suggests that the BOSC method is an effective tool for measuring changes in rhythmic activity in the more common research scenario wherein state is unknown.},

	Abstract = {Background: Filtering is a ubiquitous step in the preprocessing of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Besides the intended effect of the attenuation of signal components considered as noise, filtering can also result in various unintended adverse filter effects (distortions such as smoothing) and filter artifacts.
Method: We give some practical guidelines for the evaluation of filter responses (impulse and frequency response) and the selection of filter types (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; finite/infinite impulse response, FIR/IIR) and filter parameters (cutoff frequencies, filter order and roll-off, ripple, delay and causality) to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and avoid or reduce signal distortions for selected electrophysiological applications.
Results: Various filter implementations in common electrophysiology software packages are introduced and discussed. Resulting filter responses are compared and evaluated.
Conclusion: We present strategies for recognizing common adverse filter effects and filter artifacts and demonstrate them in practical examples. Best practices and recommendations for the selection and reporting of filter parameters, limitations, and alternatives to filtering are discussed.},

Reproducible spike time patterns may be obscured on single trials by uncontrolled temporal variability in behavior and cognition, or may not even be time locked to measurable signatures in either behavior or local field potentials (LFP). To overcome these challenges, we describe a general-purpose time warping framework that reveals precise spike-time patterns in an unsupervised manner, even when spiking is decoupled from behavior or is temporally stretched across single trials. We demonstrate this method across diverse systems: cued reaching in nonhuman primates, motor sequence production in rats, and olfaction in mice.

Here we use depth imaging to show that 3D mouse pose dynamics are structured at the sub-second timescale. Computational modeling of these fast dynamics effectively describes mouse behavior as a series of reused and stereotyped modules with defined transition probabilities. We demonstrate this combined 3D imaging and machine learning method can be used to unmask potential strategies employed by the brain to adapt to the environment, to capture both predicted and previously hidden phenotypes caused by genetic or neural manipulations, and to systematically expose the global structure of behavior within an experiment. This work reveals that mouse body language is built from identifiable components and is organized in a predictable fashion; deciphering this language establishes an objective framework for characterizing the influence of environmental cues, genes and neural activity on behavior.},

	Abstract = {During the past two decades, it has been convincingly demonstrated that schizophrenic patients and subjects genetically at risk for schizophrenia show abnormalities of cortical and particularly prefrontal function. Depending on clinical state and task conditions, hypo- and hyperfrontality have been frequently described with functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques; however, the underlying neurophysiological deficits remained largely obscure. There is now growing empirical evidence that cortical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during information processing is fundamentally disturbed and may be key to a further understanding of schizophrenic pathophysiology. The evidence comes from animal and human electrophysiological and neuroimaging investigations as well as neuropsychological and computational simulation studies. This research has also shown that dopamine signaling in prefrontal cortex is a critical factor in modulation of cortical SNR and in neurocognitive performance. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that genetically determined variations in dopamine signaling, mediated by a functional polymorphism in the gene for the enzyme catechol-o-methyltransferase, has a significant impact on the cortical SNR, prefrontal information processing, and as a result, is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. This review summarizes the current state of research on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia with emphasis on cortical-SNR and the involvement of potentially relevant, molecular and genetic determinants of the cortical dopaminergic signaling.},

	Abstract = {Stimulation efficiency is an important consideration in the stimulation parameters of implantable neural stimulators. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of waveform shape and duration on the charge, power, and energy efficiency of neural stimulation. Using a population model of mammalian axons and in vivo experiments on cat sciatic nerve, we analyzed the stimulation efficiency of four waveform shapes: square, rising exponential, decaying exponential, and rising ramp. No waveform was simultaneously energy-, charge-, and power-optimal, and differences in efficiency among waveform shapes varied with pulse width (PW) For short PWs ({$\leq$} 0.1 ms), square waveforms were no less energy-efficient than exponential waveforms, and the most charge-efficient shape was the ramp. For long PWs ({$\geq$}0.5 ms), the square was the least energy-efficient and charge-efficient shape, but across most PWs, the square was the most powerefficient shape. Rising exponentials provided no practical gains in efficiency over the other shapes, and our results refute previous claims that the rising exponential is the energy-optimal shape. An improved understanding of how stimulation parameters affect stimulation efficiency will help improve the design and programming of implantable stimulators to minimize tissue damage and extend battery life.},

	Abstract = {The energy efficiency of stimulation is an important consideration for battery-powered implantable stimulators. We used a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the energy-optimal waveform shape for neural stimulation. The GA was coupled to a computational model of extracellular stimulation of a mammalian myelinated axon. As the GA progressed, waveforms became increasingly energy-efficient and converged upon an energy-optimal shape. The results of the GA were consistent across several trials, and resulting waveforms resembled truncated Gaussian curves. When constrained to monophasic cathodic waveforms, the GA produced waveforms that were symmetric about the peak, which occurred approximately during the middle of the pulse. However, when the cathodic waveforms were coupled to rectangular chargebalancing anodic pulses, the location and sharpness of the peak varied with the duration and timing (i.e., before or after cathodic phase) of the anodic phase. In a model of a population of mammalian axons and in vivo experiments on cat sciatic nerve, the GA-optimized waveforms were more energy-efficient and charge-efficient than several conventional waveform shapes used in neural stimulation. If used in implantable neural stimulators, GA-optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the frequency of recharge intervals, the volume of implanted pulse generators, and the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgeries.},

	Abstract = {The dendritic tree of neurons plays an important role in information processing in the brain. While it is thought that dendrites require independent subunits to perform most of their computations, it is still not understood how they compartmentalize into functional subunits. Here, we show how these subunits can be deduced from the properties of dendrites. We devised a formalism that links the dendritic arborization to an impedance-based tree graph and show how the topology of this graph reveals independent subunits. This analysis reveals that cooperativity between synapses decreases slowly with increasing electrical separation and thus that few independent subunits coexist. We nevertheless find that balanced inputs or shunting inhibition can modify this topology and increase the number and size of the subunits in a context-dependent manner. We also find that this dynamic recompartmentalization can enable branch-specific learning of stimulus features. Analysis of dendritic patch-clamp recording experiments confirmed our theoretical predictions.},

One such architecture, the dynamic memory network (DMN), obtained high accuracy on a variety of language tasks. However, it was not shown whether the architecture achieves strong results for question answering when supporting facts are not marked during training or whether it could be applied to other modalities such as images. Based on an analysis of the DMN, we propose several improvements to its memory and input modules. Together with these changes we introduce a novel input module for images in order to be able to answer visual questions.

We review the core details of each approach, relate them through an SVD analysis, and indicate why they can yield different levels of performance.

The model granular layer generates a finite but very long sequence of active neuron populations without recurrence, which is able to represent the passage of time. For all the possible binary patterns fed into mossy fibres, the circuit generates the same number of different sequences of active neuron populations. Model Purkinje cells that receive parallel fiber inputs from neurons in the granular layer learn to stop eliciting spikes at the timing instructed by the arrival of signals from the inferior olive. These functional roles of the granular layer and Purkinje cells are regarded as a liquid state generator and readout neurons, respectively. Thus, the cerebellum that has been considered to date as a biological counterpart of a perceptron is reinterpreted to be a liquid state machine that possesses powerful information processing capability more than a perceptron.},

Once we are able to build a cerebellar model that runs in realtime, which means that a computer simulation of 1 s in the simulated world completes within 1 s in the real world, the cerebellar model could be used as a realtime adaptive neural controller for physical hardware such as humanoid robots. In this paper, we introduce ``Realtime Cerebellum (RC)'', a new implementation of our large-scale spiking network model of the cerebellum, which was originally built to study cerebellar mechanisms for simultaneous gain and timing control and acted as a general-purpose supervised learning machine of spatiotemporal information known as reservoir computing, on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Owing to the massive parallel computing capability of a GPU, RC runs in realtime, while reproducing qualitatively the same simulation results of the Pavlovian delay eyeblink conditioning with the previous version. RC is adopted as a realtime adaptive controller of a humanoid robot, which is instructed to learn a proper timing to swing a bat to hit a flying ball online. These results suggest that RC provides a means to apply the computational power of the cerebellum as a versatile supervised learning machine towards engineering applications.},

	Abstract = {In image classification, visual separability between different object categories is highly uneven, and some categories are more difficult to distinguish than others. Such difficult categories demand more dedicated classifiers. However, existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are trained as flat N-way classifiers, and few efforts have been made to leverage the hierarchical structure of categories. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical deep CNNs (HD-CNNs) by embedding deep CNNs into a category hierarchy. An HD-CNN separates easy classes using a coarse category classifier while distinguishing difficult classes using fine category classifiers. During HD-CNN training, component-wise pretraining is followed by global finetuning with a multinomial logistic loss regularized by a coarse category consistency term. In addition, conditional executions of fine category classifiers and layer parameter compression make HD-CNNs scalable for large-scale visual recognition. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both CIFAR100 and large-scale ImageNet 1000-class benchmark datasets. In our experiments, we build up three different HD-CNNs and they lower the top-1 error of the standard CNNs by 2.65\%, 3.1\% and 1.1\%, respectively.},

We develop practical mean field Q-learning and mean field Actor-Critic algorithms and analyze the convergence of the solution to Nash equilibrium.

	Abstract = {Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years. Recent methods such as curiosity-driven exploration usually estimate the novelty of new observations by the prediction errors of their system dynamics models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to the RL domain and utilize the errors from optical flow estimation to evaluate the novelty of new observations. We introduce a flow-based intrinsic curiosity module (FICM) capable of learning the motion features and understanding the observations in a more comprehensive and efficient fashion. We evaluate our method and compare it with a number of baselines on several benchmark environments, including Atari games, Super Mario Bros., and ViZDoom. Our results show that the proposed method is superior to the baselines in certain environments, especially for those featuring sophisticated moving patterns or with high-dimensional observation spaces. We further analyze the hyper-parameters used in the training phase and discuss our insights into them.},

	Abstract = {Among electrophysiological signals, Local Field Potentials (LFPs) are extensively used to study brain activity, either in vivo or in vitro. LFPs are recorded with extracellular electrodes implanted in brain tissue. They reflect intermingled excitatory and inhibitory processes in neuronal assemblies. In cortical structures, LFPs mainly originate from the summation of post-synaptic potentials (PSPs), either excitatory (ePSPs) and inhibitory (iPSPs) generated at the level of pyramidal cells. The challenging issue, addressed in this paper, is to estimate, from a single extracellularly-recorded signal, both ePSP and iPSP components of the LFP. The proposed method is based on a model-based reverse engineering approach in which the measured LFP is fed into a physiologically-grounded neural mass model (mesoscopic level) in order to estimate the synaptic activity of a sub-population of pyramidal cells interacting with local GABAergic interneurons. The method was first validated using simulated LFPs for which excitatory and inhibitory components are known a priori and can thus serve as a ground truth. It was then evaluated on in vivo data (PTZ-induced seizures, rat; PTZ-induced excitability increase, mouse; epileptiform discharges, mouse) and on in clinico data (human seizures recorded with depth-EEG electrodes). Under these various conditions, results showed that the proposed reverse engineering method provides a reliable estimation of the average excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials at the origin of the measured LFPs. They also indicated that the method allows for monitoring of the excitation/inhibition ratio. The method has potential for multiple applications in neuroscience, typically when a time tracking of local excitability changes is required.},

@article{Yoon2008,
	Abstract = {Background: Multivariate pattern analysis is an alternative method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, which is capable of decoding distributed neural representations. We applied this method to test the hypothesis of the impairment in distributed representations in schizophrenia. We also compared the results of this method with traditional general linear model (GLM)-based univariate analysis.
Methods: Nineteen schizophrenia and 15 control subjects viewed two runs of stimuli\textemdash{} exemplars of faces, scenes, objects, and scrambled images. To verify engagement with stimuli, subjects completed a 1-back matching task. A multivoxel pattern classifier was trained to identify category-specific activity patterns on one run of fMRI data. Classification testing was conducted on the remaining run. Correlation of voxelwise activity across runs evaluated variance over time in activity patterns.
Results: Patients performed the task less accurately. This group difference was reflected in the pattern analysis results with diminished classification accuracy in patients compared with control subjects, 59\% and 72\%, respectively. In contrast, there was no group difference in GLM-based univariate measures. In both groups, classification accuracy was significantly correlated with behavioral measures. Both groups showed highly significant correlation between interrun correlations and classification accuracy.
Conclusions: Distributed representations of visual objects are impaired in schizophrenia. This impairment is correlated with diminished task performance, suggesting that decreased integrity of cortical activity patterns is reflected in impaired behavior. Comparisons with univariate results suggest greater sensitivity of pattern analysis in detecting group differences in neural activity and reduced likelihood of nonspecific factors driving these results.},

@article{Yoon2018,
	Abstract = {During foraging, animals decide how long to stay at a patch and harvest reward, and then, they move with certain vigor to another location. How does the brain decide when to leave, and how does it determine the speed of the ensuing movement? Here, we considered the possibility that both the decision-making and the motor control problems aimed to maximize a single normative utility: the sum of all rewards acquired minus all efforts expended divided by total time. This optimization could be achieved if the brain compared a local measure of utility with its history. To test the theory, we examined behavior of people as they gazed at images: they chose how long to look at the image (harvesting information) and then moved their eyes to another image, controlling saccade speed. We varied reward via image content and effort via image eccentricity, and then, we measured how these changes affected decision making (gaze duration) and motor control (saccade speed). After a history of low rewards, people increased gaze duration and decreased saccade speed. In anticipation of future effort, they lowered saccade speed and increased gaze duration. After a history of high effort, they elevated their saccade speed and increased gaze duration. Therefore, the theory presented a principled way with which the brain may control two aspects of behavior: movement speed and harvest duration. Our experiments confirmed many (but not all) of the predictions, suggesting that harvest duration and movement speed, fundamental aspects of behavior during foraging, may be governed by a shared principle of control.},

@article{Yosinski2014,
	Abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

@article{Yu,
	Abstract = {In a variety of behavioral tasks, subjects exhibit an automatic and apparently suboptimal sequential effect: they respond more rapidly and accurately to a stimulus if it reinforces a local pattern in stimulus history, such as a string of repetitions or alternations, compared to when it violates such a pattern. This is often the case even if the local trends arise by chance in the context of a randomized design, such that stimulus history has no real predictive power. In this work, we use a normative Bayesian framework to examine the hypothesis that such idiosyncrasies may reflect the inadvertent engagement of mechanisms critical for adapting to a changing environment. We show that prior belief in non-stationarity can induce experimentally observed sequential effects in an otherwise Bayes-optimal algorithm. The Bayesian algorithm is shown to be well approximated by linear-exponential filtering of past observations, a feature also apparent in the behavioral data. We derive an explicit relationship between the parameters and computations of the exact Bayesian algorithm and those of the approximate linear-exponential filter. Since the latter is equivalent to a leaky-integration process, a commonly used model of neuronal dynamics underlying perceptual decision-making and trial-to-trial dependencies, our model provides a principled account of why such dynamics are useful. We also show that parameter-tuning of the leaky-integration process is possible, using stochastic gradient descent based only on the noisy binary inputs. This is a proof of concept that not only can neurons implement near-optimal prediction based on standard neuronal dynamics, but that they can also learn to tune the processing parameters without explicitly representing probabilities.},

	Abstract = {The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that over-parameterization of deep neural networks (DNNs) aids training by increasing the probability of a ``lucky'' sub-network initialization being present rather than by helping the optimization process (Frankle \& Carbin, 2019). Intriguingly, this phenomenon suggests that initialization strategies for DNNs can be improved substantially, but the lottery ticket hypothesis has only previously been tested in the context of supervised learning for natural image tasks. Here, we evaluate whether ``winning ticket'' initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with work in supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL. Notably, we are able to find winning ticket initializations for Transformers which enable models one-third the size to achieve nearly equivalent performance. Together, these results suggest that the lottery ticket hypothesis is not restricted to supervised learning of natural images, but rather represents a broader phenomenon in DNNs.},

	Abstract = {While deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated impressive results in domains such as image classification, game playing, and robotic control, data efficiency remains a major challenge. Multi-task learning has emerged as a promising approach for sharing structure across multiple tasks to enable more efficient learning. However, the multi-task setting presents a number of optimization challenges, making it difficult to realize large efficiency gains compared to learning tasks independently. The reasons why multi-task learning is so challenging compared to single-task learning are not fully understood. In this work, we identify a set of three conditions of the multi-task optimization landscape that cause detrimental gradient interference, and develop a simple yet general approach for avoiding such interference between task gradients. We propose a form of gradient surgery that projects a task's gradient onto the normal plane of the gradient of any other task that has a conflicting gradient. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised and multi-task RL problems, this approach leads to substantial gains in efficiency and performance. Further, it is model-agnostic and can be combined with previously-proposed multitask architectures for enhanced performance.},

	Abstract = {The induced gamma-band EEG response (iGBR) recorded on the scalp is widely assumed to reflect synchronous neural oscillation associated with object representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. The most commonly reported EEG iGBR is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range \$200\textendash{}300 ms following stimulus onset. A conspicuous feature of this iGBR is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using singletrial analysis of concomitant EEG and eye tracking, that this iGBR is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic ``spike potential.'' The time course of the iGBR is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Neural mass models are successful in modeling brain rhythms as observed in macroscopic measurements such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). While the synaptic current is explicitly modeled in current models, the single cell electrophysiology is not taken into account. To allow for investigations of the effects of channel pathologies, channel blockers and ion concentrations on macroscopic activity, we formulate neural mass equations explicitly incorporating the single cell dynamics by using a bottom-up approach. The mean and variance of the firing rate and synaptic input distributions are modeled. The firing rate curve (F(I)-curve) is used as link between the single cell and macroscopic dynamics. We show that this model accurately reproduces the behavior of two populations of synaptically connected Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, also in non-steady state.},

	Abstract = {Traveling waves of neural activity are frequently observed to occur in concert with the presentation of a sensory stimulus or the execution of a movement. Although such waves have been studied for decades, little is known about their function. Here we show that traveling waves in the primate extrastriate visual cortex provide a means of integrating sensory and motor signals. Specifically, we describe a traveling wave of local field potential (LFP) activity in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys that is triggered by the execution of saccadic eye movements. These waves sweep across the V4 retinotopic map, following a consistent path from the foveal to the peripheral representations of space; their amplitudes correlate with the direction and size of each saccade. Moreover, these waves are associated with a reorganization of the postsaccadic neuronal firing patterns, which follow a similar retinotopic progression, potentially prioritizing the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

However, the neural processes underlying this effect remain underexplored, especially in the context of normal aging. To address this, we examined younger and older adults' performance in a motion detection task. In separate conditions, the probability was either 50\% or 100\% that a field of dots would move coherently in the direction a participant expected (either vertically or horizontally). Expectation and aging effects were assessed via response times (RT) to detect motion and electroencephalography (EEG). In both age groups, RTs were fastest when motion was similar to the expected direction of motion. RT tuning curves exhibited a characteristic U-shape such that detection time increased with an increasing deviation from the participant's expected direction. Strikingly, EEG results showed an analogous, hyperbolic curve for N1 amplitude, reflecting neural biasing. Though the form of behavioral and EEG curves did not vary with age, older adults displayed a clear decline in the speed of detection and a corresponding reduction in EEG N1 amplitude when horizontal (but not vertical) motion was expected. Our results suggest that expectation-based detection ability varies with age and, for older adults, also with axis of motion.},

	Abstract = {Deep learning has led to remarkable advances when applied to problems where the data distribution does not change over the course of learning. In stark contrast, biological neural networks continually adapt to changing domains, and solve a diversity of tasks simultaneously. Furthermore, synapses in biological neurons are not simply real-valued scalars, but possess complex molecular machinery enabling non-trivial learning dynamics. In this study, we take a first step toward bringing this biological complexity into artificial neural networks. We introduce a model of intelligent synapses that accumulate task relevant information over time, and exploit this information to efficiently consolidate memories of old tasks to protect them from being overwritten as new tasks are learned. We apply our framework to learning sequences of related classification problems, and show that it dramatically reduces catastrophic forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.},

Despite the ubiquity of such spiking, we currently lack an understanding of how biological spiking neural circuits learn and compute in-vivo, as well as how we can instantiate such capabilities in artificial spiking circuits in-silico. Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multi-layer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three factor learning rule capable of training multi-layer networks of deterministic integrateand-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike-time patterns.},

	Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant progresses in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Empowered with large scale neural networks, carefully designed architectures, novel training algorithms and massively parallel computing devices, researchers are able to attack many challenging RL problems. However, in machine learning, more training power comes with a potential risk of more overfitting. As deep RL techniques are being applied to critical problems such as healthcare and finance, it is important to understand the generalization behaviors of the trained agents. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of standard RL agents and find that they could overfit in various ways. Moreover, overfitting could happen ``robustly'': commonly used techniques in RL that add stochasticity do not necessarily prevent or detect overfitting. In particular, the same agents and learning algorithms could have drastically different test performance, even when all of them achieve optimal rewards during training. The observations call for more principled and careful evaluation protocols in RL. We conclude with a general discussion on overfitting in RL and a study of the generalization behaviors from the perspective of inductive bias.},

In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

Activation of synapses in this pathway seeds memories that guide learning of song-element duration and can override learning from social interactions with other individuals. Genetic lesions of this circuit after memory formation, however, do not disrupt subsequent song imitation, which suggests that these memories are stored at downstream synapses. Thus, activity at these sensorimotor synapses can bypass learning from auditory and social experience and embed memories that guide learning of song timing.},

	Abstract = {Pairs of active neurons frequently fire action potentials or ``spikes'' nearly synchronously (i.e., within 5 ms of each other). This spike synchrony may occur by chance, based solely on the neurons' fluctuating firing patterns, or it may occur too frequently to be explicable by chance alone. When spike synchrony above chances levels is present, it may subserve computation for a specific cognitive process, or it could be an irrelevant byproduct of such computation. Either way, spike synchrony is a feature of neural data that should be explained. A point process regression framework has been developed previously for this purpose, using generalized linear models (GLMs). In this framework, the observed number of synchronous spikes is compared to the number predicted by chance under varying assumptions about the factors that affect each of the individual neuron's firing-rate functions. An important possible source of spike synchrony is network-wide oscillations, which may provide an essential mechanism of network information flow. To establish the statistical link between spike synchrony and network-wide oscillations, we have integrated oscillatory field potentials into our point process regression framework. We first extended a previouslypublished model of spike-field association and showed that we could recover phase relationships between oscillatory field potentials and firing rates. We then used this new framework to demonstrate the statistical relationship between oscillatory field potentials and spike synchrony in: 1) simulated neurons, 2) in vitro recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and 3) in vivo recordings of neocortical V4 neurons. Our results provide a rigorous method for establishing a statistical link between network oscillations and neural synchrony.},

@article{Zylberberg2017,
	Abstract = {Accurate decisions require knowledge of prior probabilities (e.g., prevalence or base rate) but it is unclear how prior probability is learned in the absence of a teacher. We hypothesized that humans could learn base rates from experience making decisions, even without feedback. Participants made difficult decisions about the direction of dynamic random dot motion. For each block of 15-42 trials, the base rate favored left or right by a different amount. Participants were not informed of the base rate, yet they gradually biased their choices and thereby increased accuracy and confidence in their decisions. They achieved this by updating knowledge of base rate after each decision, using a counterfactual representation of confidence that simulates a neutral prior. The strategy is consistent with Bayesian updating of belief and suggests that humans represent both true confidence, that incorporates the evolving belief of the prior, and counterfactual confidence that discounts the prior.},
