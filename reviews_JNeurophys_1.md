Dear Dr. Peterson, 

You will find with this letter the comments of the referees of your manuscript, "Homeostatic mechanisms may shape the type and duration of oscillatory modulation." Although the topic of your manuscript is important, the reviewers raised major concerns about the interpretation and presentation of the findings. 

Our policy is that Rapid Reports cannot require more than minor revisions following initial review. In light of the extensive concerns articulated below, JNP will not be able to publish the current version of the manuscript. However, considering the importance of this line of research, we would be willing to consider a new REGULAR RESEARCH manuscript on the same topic. 

Please note that such a resubmission would be considered a new manuscript, and would be processed accordingly. The resubmission will be assigned a new manuscript number. The original reviewers may not be available to consider the paper, such that new reviewers may be selected. Hence, it is uncertain whether the new submission would eventually be accepted. 

If you choose to resubmit the paper, please pay careful attention to the following requirements: 

1) indicate the previous manuscript number in your cover letter to the editor. 

2) attach a point-by-point response to the previous referee comments as supporting material (as a separate file from the cover letter). 

If you choose to submit the manuscript elsewhere, please note that the Journal of Neurophysiology participates in the Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium (http://nprc.incf.org). A listing of journals that participate in the Consortium is available at: http://nprc.incf.org/journals. We will provide these reviews to another journal that participates in the Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium, without the reviewers' names, if they wish to remain unidentified. Please send requests for transfer of reviews to the Journal of Neurophysiology Editorial Assistant: jnpoffice@the-aps.org. 

We assure you that the negative outcome of the review of this manuscript in no way precludes a more positive outcome of a different future study, and strongly encourage you to continue to submit your work to JNP. 

Yours sincerely, 
Bill Yates, Ph.D.
Editor-in-Chief, JNP

Reviewer #1 (Comments to the Author):

In this manuscript, the authors developed a simplified computational model able to explore basic interactions between neural oscillations and homeostasis. They found that oscillations that differ in the time domain (tonic or burst of oscillations) also affect differently to the homeostasis of the system, in a non trivial way, what could be directly related to some of the proposed underlying mechanisms of neural information processing during cognitive functions. I find the idea of the manuscript very interesting and novel, the proposed questions are properly addressed and limitations are clarified. The main finding that tonic excitatory oscillations desynchronize firing under homeostatic changes is of great interest and open new interesting interpretations of several experimental phenomena available in the field. I would recommend to clarify a few minor points before publication: 

1) The authors adressed the impact of homeostasis in tonic and burst-like oscillations, both of them considered at 8Hz. What would be the impact of their model when considering oscillations in different ranges of the frequency domain? The model is based in a feed-forward population of hippocampal pyramidal cells and it is known that in the hippocampus both types of oscillations (tonic and burst-like) are present. An example of tonic would be theta oscillations (8 Hz), which underlying inhibitory drive the authors interpreted as possibly related with their results. On the other hand, burst-like oscillations exist in the hippocampus such as different gamma band oscillations (60 Hz, 90 Hz) and ripples (150 Hz). In addition to cortical oscillations, if the authors could interpret their findings in terms of these different burst-like hippocampal oscillations, it would enhance the message of the paper since it would be easier to relate to empirical data. 

2) In Figure 2 c.d, the model predicts a decrease of both synchrony and excitability for AMPA driven tonic oscillations with increasing oscillation strength. However, due to the low excitability that the system reaches around half of the strength of the oscillation, an inflection point and succesive discontinuity appears for the syncrhony. The authors explain this in the paper as a result of the mathematical limitations of the model. However, physiologically, it is mostly not feasible that the system reaches an excitability point where the population rate is constant zero for long periods of time. Do the authors think that modifying the implementation of the background level noise in their model this could be corrected? 

After these points have been addressed, I highly recommend the publication of this very interesting study this Journal. 



Reviewer #2 (Comments to the Author):

This paper assesses the impact of homeostasis on simulated model neurons receiving inputs that are either oscillatory, transiently bursting, or tonic. The authors find that increasing excitatory oscillatory input results in a homeostatic response that, when reaching an appropriate level of mean calcium, overcompensates the postsynaptic neuron's spiking response. That is, paradoxically, an increase in drive when combined with homeostasis results in a decreased response. 

I think the main effect-which according to the authors does not occur with inhibitory oscillatory drive-is of interest and worth exploring more thoroughly. Under what conditions does it occur? What types of calcium channels are essential, what are inessential? Does spiking threshold or leak conductance matter? As it stands though, the paper provides one example of the effect without enough corresponding examples to allow the reader to understand precisely how the effect arises and why. I think I know the reason, but even a statement such as the one in the opening paragraph of this review is not present in the text. I suspect some simple controls, perhaps comparing high-threshold calcium channels versus low-threshold calcium channels as the main conveyors of calcium entry in the soma, would help provide some insight into the nature of the observed phenomenon. 

Some of the ways the authors discuss the effect are a little counterintuitive - as though the behavior of the network is in place so as to become compatible with homeostasis, rather than the generally understood notion that homeostasis is present to ensure the network is stable. If it really is the general case that excitatory-input oscillations are incompatible with homeostasis then it is fine to generalize in this way, but a single example is insufficient-I can imagine other ways in which oscillations arising from excitatory input remain stable in the presence of homeostasis (I imagine it is all channel-type-dependent and parameter-dependent). It may be worth demonstrating that the homeostatic rhythmic model of O'Leary and Marder also fails with rhythmic excitatory input. 

A final general point - I find the writing rather unpolished in places, with non-grammatical sentences, and recommend careful editing in any future version. 

Specific comments: 

l.48 "kinetics of ion channels": I have not seen evidence of channel kinetics changing, only expression levels, so please cite the appropriate evidence. 

l.58 An increase in threshold is not paradoxical, but, rather, the standard, expected homeostatic response. 

l.82 On the "radical difference between real and simulated timescales": there is no clear justification for simulating a timescale that is radically different from the real one. In the absence of such justification, I recommend using the correct timescale. 

l. 232 the background rate, r_b is not used in any equations so hard to tell which conditions and under what circumstances it is ever used. Also I don't see r_s used in the equations in the methods. 


Minor points: 

l. 27 "this quench" (invert) 

l.114 "change in Ca..." 
l.118 "effect" written twice 
l.129 "increase or decrease" 

l. 148 comma after oscillations. 
l. 167 "that" is wrong 

l. 170 "For example .." this is not a complete sentence. 

l.227 you have not specified which cells in the model comprise the hippocampal population 

l.230 The math equation looks like you are dividing by the parentheses instead of multiplying. I would put parentheses around r_0/2 to be clear. 




Reviewer #3 (Comments to the Author):

See attached review.

As I no longer do anonymous reviews, I would like to identify myself with my review (Frances Skinner). 

In this paper, the authors add calcium-dependent homeostatic mechanisms to a feedforward network and find a paradoxical effect for tonic oscillations that are synaptically excitatory. This seems interesting, but after some effort, I found that I was unable to parse and evaluate and kept trying to ‘fill in the blanks’. In essence, my main comments are that I am unclear about various details (sorry if I missed them somewhere). 

For example:

1) what is the connectivity (if any) of the 100 HH neurons? (and how does it affect results?) 2) how does the connectivity and synaptic weights (from N to M as given in methods) affect results?
3) incomplete/inconsistent parameters – e.g., what inhibitory reversal potential used? Is V_e in Table same as E_s in eqn 3?
4) confusing/incomplete descriptions – e.g., they say that the ‘stimulus population is modeled by a fixed rate of 6 Hz’, but is this the rate that is changing in the figures? I am not sure what (parameters) are being changed (and how) when they say (line 77) the oscillatory strength, duration... The methods refer to a uniform distribution.
5) line 95/96: they say that “...increasing the strength of the excitatory oscillation increases excitability leading to an increase in the population firing rate”. I am confused – I thought they said that they are using ‘population firing rate’ as a measure of ‘excitability’ (bottom of p.2). Also, as per comments above, I am not sure exactly what is being done when they say that they are ‘increasing the strength of the excitatory oscillation’
6) what is meant by the ‘firing threshold’ (line 59). That is, please define/specify what is intended to avoid confusion/circularity.
Once this is clarified, it seems to me that the authors should provide some insight to their paradoxical result (or at least explanation by doing enough numerical explorations) E.g., are the differences a matter of different driving forces with excitatory and inhibitory?
Minor: line 88 – not a sentence – “Both of which...”
